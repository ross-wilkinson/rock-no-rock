abstract = {In the present study, the in vivo force-length relations of the human soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were estimated. Measurements were taken in six men at ankle angles from 30° of dorsiflexion to 45° of plantarflexion in steps of 15°, and involved dynamometry, electrical stimulation, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For each muscle and ankle angle studied the following three measurements were carried out: (1) dynamometry-based measurement of maximal voltage tetanic moment, (2) ultrasound-based measurement of pennation angle and fibre length and (3) MRI-based measurement of tendon moment arm length. Tendon forces were calculated dividing moments by moment arm lengths, and muscle forces were calculated dividing tendon forces by the cosine of pennation angles. In the transition from 30° of dorsiflexion to 45° of plantarflexion the SOL muscle fibre length decreased from 3.8 to 2.4 cm and its force decreased from 3330 to 290 N. Over the same range of ankle angles the TA muscle fibre length increased from 3.7 to 6 cm and its force increased from 157 to 644 N. Over the longest muscle fibre lengths reached the force of both muscles remained approximately constant. These results indicate that the intact human SOL and TA muscles operate in the ascending limb and plateau region of the force-length relationship. Similar conclusions were reached when calculating the theoretical operating range of the two muscle sarcomeres in the study.},

abstract = {The use of standardised tools is an essential component of evidence-based practice. Reliance on standardised tools places demands on clinicians to understand their properties, strengths, and weaknesses, in order to interpret results and make clinical decisions. This paper makes a case for clinicians to consider measurement error (ME) indices Coefficient of Repeatability (CR) or the Smallest Real Difference (SRD) over relative reliability coefficients like the Pearson's (r) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), while selecting tools to measure change and inferring change as true. The authors present statistical methods that are part of the current approach to evaluate test-retest reliability of assessment tools and outcome measurements. Selected examples from a previous test-retest study are used to elucidate the added advantages of knowledge of the ME of an assessment tool in clinical decision making. The CR is computed in the same units as the assessment tool and sets the boundary of the minimal detectable true change that can be measured by the tool. {\textcopyright} 2013 Vaz et al.},

abstract = {Background The unipodal stance task is a clinical task that quantifies postural stability and alignment of the lower limb joints, while weight bearing on one leg. As persons with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) have poor postural and knee joint stability, objective assessment of this task might be useful. Objective To investigate the discriminant validity of three-dimensional joint kinematics and centre of mass displacement (COM) between healthy controls and persons with knee KOA, during unipodal stance using inertial sensors. Additionally, the reliability, agreement and construct validity are assessed to determine the reproducibility and accuracy of the discriminating parameters. Methods Twenty healthy controls and 19 persons with unilateral severe KOA were included. Five repetitions of the unipodal stance task were simultaneously recorded by an inertial sensor system and a camera-based system (gold standard). Statistical significant differences in kinematic waveforms between healthy controls and persons with severe knee KOA were determined using one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping (SPM1D). Results Persons with severe knee KOA had more lateral trunk lean towards the contralateral leg, more hip flexion throughout the performance of the unipodal stance task, more pelvic obliquity and COM displacement towards the contralateral side. However, for the latter two parameters the minimum detectable change was greater than the difference between healthy controls and persons with severe knee KOA. The construct validity was good (coefficient of multiple correlation 0.75, 0.83 respectively) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) was low (RMSE {\textless}1.5°) for the discriminant parameters. Conclusion Inertial sensor based movement analysis can discriminate between healthy controls and persons with severe knee KOA for lateral trunk lean and hip flexion, but unfortunately not for the knee angles. Further research is required to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of the inertial sensor measurements before they can be used to assess differences in tasks with a small range of motion.},

abstract = {Cyclists frequently use a non-seated posture when accelerating, climbing steep hills, and sprinting; yet, the biomechanical difference between seated and non-seated cycling remains unclear. Purpose To test the effects of posture (seated and non-seated) and cadence (70 rpm and 120 rpm) on joint power contributions, effective mechanical advantage, and muscle activations within the leg during very-high-power output cycling. Methods Fifteen male participants rode on an instrumented ergometer at 50{\%} of their individualised instantaneous maximal power (10.74 ± 1.99 W⋅kg-1; above the reported threshold for seated to non-seated transition) in different postures (seated and non-seated) and at different cadences (70 rpm and 120 rpm); whilst leg muscle activity, full body motion capture, and crank radial and tangential forces were recorded. A scaled, full-body model was used to solve inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics to determine joint displacements and net joint moments. Statistical comparisons were made using repeated measure, two-way analyses of variance (posture x cadence). Results There were significant main effects of posture and cadence on joint power contributions. A key finding was that the non-seated posture increased negative power at the knee, with an associated significant decrease of net power at the knee. The contribution of knee power decreased by 15{\%} at both 70 and 120 rpm ({\~{}}=0.8 W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) when non-seated compared to seated. Subsequently, hip power and ankle power contributions were significantly higher when non-seated compared to seated at both cadences. In both postures, knee power was 9{\%} lower at 120 rpm compared to 70 rpm ({\~{}}=0.4 W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1). Conclusion These results evidenced that the contribution of knee joint power to leg power was reduced by switching from a seated to non-seated posture during very-high-power output cycling, however the size of the reduction is cadence dependent.

abstract = {People with diabetes display biomechanical gait alterations compared to controls and have a higher metabolic cost of walking (CoW), but it remains unknown whether differences in the vertical displacement of the body centre of mass (CoM) may play a role in this higher CoW. The aim of this study was to investigate vertical CoM displacement (and step length as a potential underpinning factor) as an explanatory factor in the previously observed increased CoW with diabetes. Thirty-one non-diabetic controls (Ctrl); 22 diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy (DM) and 14 patients with moderate/severe Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), underwent gait analysis using a motion analysis system and force plates while walking at a range of matched speeds between 0.6 and 1.6 m/s. Vertical displacement of the CoM was measured over the gait cycle, and was not different in either diabetes patients with or without diabetic peripheral neuropathy compared to controls across the range of matched walking speeds examined (at 1 m/s: Ctrl: 5.59 (SD: 1.6), DM: 5.41 (1.63), DPN: 4.91 (1.66) cm; p {\textgreater} 0.05). The DPN group displayed significantly shorter steps (at 1 m/s: Ctrl: 69, DM: 67, DPN: 64 cm; p {\textgreater} 0.05) and higher cadence (at 1 m/s: Ctrl: 117 (SD1.12), DM: 119 (1.08), DPN: 122 (1.25) steps per minute; p {\textgreater} 0.05) across all walking speeds compared to controls. The vertical CoM displacement is therefore unlikely to be a factor in itself that contributes towards the higher CoW observed recently in people with diabetic neuropathy. The higher CoW in patients with diabetes may not be explained by the CoM displacement, but rather may be more related to shorter step lengths, increased cadence and the associated increased internal work and higher muscle forces developed by walking with more flexed joints.},

abstract = {For a valid determination of a rower's mechanical power output, the anterior–posterior (AP) acceleration of a rower's centre of mass (CoM) is required. The current study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of the determination of this acceleration using a full-body inertial measurement units (IMUs) suit in combination with a mass distribution model. Three methods were evaluated. In the first two methods, IMU data were combined with either a subject-specific mass distribution or a standard mass distribution model for athletes. In the third method, a rower's AP CoM acceleration was estimated using a single IMU placed at the pelvis. Experienced rowers rowed on an ergometer that was placed on two force plates, while wearing a full-body IMUs suit. Correspondence values between AP CoM acceleration based on IMU data (the three methods) and AP CoM acceleration obtained from force plate data (reference) were calculated. Good correspondence was found between the reference AP CoM acceleration and the AP CoM accelerations determined using IMU data in combination with the subject-specific mass model and the standard mass model (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC] {\textgreater} 0.988 and normalized root mean square errors [nRMSE] 3.81{\%}). Correspondence was lower for the AP CoM accelerations determined using a single pelvis IMU (0.877 {\textless} ICC {\textless} 0.960 and 6.11{\%} {\textless} nRMSE {\textless} 13.61{\%}). Based on these results, we recommend determining a rower's AP CoM acceleration using IMUs in combination with the standard mass model. Finally, we conclude that accurate determination of a rower's AP CoM acceleration is not possible on the basis of the pelvis acceleration only.},

abstract = {The motion of centre of mass (CoM) is a fundamental object of investigation in biomechanical analysis. In principle, the CoM motion can either be calculated from force data (dynamic method) or motion capture data (kinematic method). In both approaches, the accuracy of the calculated trajectories depends on the quality of the original signals. Interestingly, the inaccuracies in each method are related to different parts of the Fourier spectrum. Here, we present a new approach to compute CoM motion based on the reliable frequency range of force and kinematic measurements. As a result we obtain physically consistent CoM and force signals, i.e. the second derivative of the CoM trajectory equals the force. The algorithm is verified on simulation data and applied to selected experimental data. We show that the new algorithm can eliminate typical inaccuracies inherent in kinematic and force signals. Also, we discuss the biological and technical origins of these findings. {\textcopyright} 2011. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract = {Measuring the vertical displacement of the center of mass (COM) of the body during walking may provide useful information about the energy required to walk. Four methods of varying complexity to estimate the vertical displacement of the COM were compared in 25 able-bodied, female subjects. The first method, the sacral marker method, utilized an external marker on the sacrum as representative of the COM of the body. The second method, the reconstructed pelvis method, which also utilized a marker over the sacrum, theoretically controlled for pelvic tilt motion. The third method, the segmental analysis method, involved measuring motion of the trunk and limb segments. The fourth method, the forceplate method, involved estimating the COM displacement from ground reaction force measurements. A two-tailed paired t-test within an ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference between the sacral marker and the reconstructed pelvis methods (p = 0.839). There was also no statistically significant difference between the sacral marker and the segmental analysis method (p = 0.119) or between the reconstructed pelvis and the segmental analysis method (p = 0.174). It follows that the first method, which is the most simple, can provide essentially the same estimate of the vertical displacement of the COM as the more complicated second and third measures. The forceplate method produced data with a lower range and a different distribution than the other three methods. There was a statistically significant difference between the forceplate method and the other methods (p {\textless} 0.01 for each of the three comparisons). The forceplate method provides information that is statistically significantly different from the results of the kinematic methods. The magnitude of the difference is large enough to be physiologically significant and further studies to define the sources of the differences and the relative validity of the two approaches are warranted. {\textcopyright} 1998 by ASME.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether high inter-individual variability of the electromyographic (EMG) patterns during pedaling is accompanied by variability in the pedal force application patterns. Eleven male experienced cyclists were tested at two submaximal power outputs (150 and 250 W). Pedal force components (effective and total forces) and index of mechanical effectiveness were measured continuously using instrumented pedals and were synchronized with surface electromyography signals measured in ten lower limb muscles. The intersubject variability of EMG and mechanical patterns was assessed using standard deviation, mean deviation, variance ratio and coefficient of cross-correlation (R0 with lag time = 0). The results demonstrated a high intersubject variability of EMG patterns at both exercise intensities for biarticular muscles as a whole (and especially for Gastrocnemius lateralis and Rectus femoris) and for one monoarticular muscle (Tibialis anterior). However, this heterogeneity of EMG patterns is not accompanied by a so high intersubject variability in pedal force application patterns. A very low variability in the three mechanical profiles (effective force, total force and index of mechanical effectiveness) was obtained in the propulsive downstroke phase, although a greater variability in these mechanical patterns was found during upstroke and around the top dead center, and at 250 W when compared to 150 W. Overall, these results provide additional evidence for redundancy in the neuromuscular system. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract = {This paper overviews the importance for sports biomechanics of movement variability, which has been studied for some time by cognitive and ecological motor skills specialists but, until quite recently, had somewhat been overlooked by sports biomechanists. The paper considers biomechanics research reporting inter- and intra-individual movement variability in javelin and discus throwing, basketball shooting, and locomotion. The overview does not claim to be comprehensive and we exclude such issues as the theoretical background to movement and coordination variability and their measurement. We overview evidence, both theoretical and empirical, of inter-individual movement variability in seeking to achieve the same task goal, in contrast to the concept of "optimal" movement patterns. Furthermore, even elite athletes cannot reproduce identical movement patterns after many years of training, contradicting the ideas of motor invariance and "representative" trials. We contend that movement variability, far from being solely due to neuromuscular system or measurement "noise" - as sports biomechanists may have previously supposed - is, or could be, functional. Such functionality could allow environmental adaptations, reduce injury risk, and facilitate changes in coordination patterns. We conclude by recommending that sports biomechanists should focus more of their research on movement variability and on important related topics, such as control and coordination of movement, and implications for practice and skill learning.},

abstract = {We mapped structural and functional characteristics of muscle-tendon units in a population exposed to very long-term routine overloading. Twenty-eight military academy cadets (age = 21.00 ± 1.1 years; height = 176.1 ± 4.8 cm; mass = 73.8 ± 7.0 kg) exposed for over 24 months to repetitive overloading were profiled via ultrasonography with a senior subgroup of them (n = 11; age = 21.4 ± 1.0 years; height = 176.5 ± 4.8 cm; mass = 71.4 ± 6.6 kg) also tested while walking and marching on a treadmill. A group of eleven ethnicity- and age-matched civilians (age = 21.6 ± 0.7 years; height = 176.8 ± 4.3 cm; mass = 74.6 ± 5.6 kg) was also profiled and tested. Cadets and civilians exhibited similar morphology (muscle and tendon thickness and cross-sectional area, pennation angle, fascicle length) in 26 out of 29 sites including the Achilles tendon. However, patellar tendon thickness along the entire tendon was greater (P {\textless}.05) by a mean of 16{\%} for the senior cadets compared with civilians. Dynamically, cadets showed significantly smaller ranges of fascicle length change and lower shortening velocity in medial gastrocnemius during walking (44.0{\%} and 47.6{\%}, P {\textless}.05-.01) and marching (27.5{\%} and 34.3{\%}, P {\textless}.05-.01) than civilians. Furthermore, cadets showed lower normalized soleus electrical activity during walking (22.7{\%}, P {\textless}.05) and marching (27.0{\%}, P {\textless}.05). Therefore, 24-36 months of continuous overloading, primarily occurring under aerobic conditions, leads to more efficient neural and mechanical behavior in the triceps surae complex, without any major macroscopic alterations in key anatomical structures.},

abstract = {Numerical data that are normally distributed can be analyzed with parametric tests, that is, tests which are based on the parameters that define a normal distribution curve. If the distribution is uncertain, the data can be plotted as a normal probability plot and visually inspected, or tested for normality using one of a number of goodness of fit tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The widely used Student's t-test has three variants. The one-sample t-test is used to assess if a sample mean (as an estimate of the population mean) differs significantly from a given population mean. The means of two independent samples may be compared for a statistically significant difference by the unpaired or independent samples t-test. If the data sets are related in some way, their means may be compared by the paired or dependent samples t-test. The t-test should not be used to compare the means of more than two groups. Although it is possible to compare groups in pairs, when there are more than two groups, this will increase the probability of a Type I error. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to compare the means of three or more independent data sets that are normally distributed. Multiple measurements from the same set of subjects cannot be treated as separate, unrelated data sets. Comparison of means in such a situation requires repeated measures ANOVA. It is to be noted that while a multiple group comparison test such as ANOVA can point to a significant difference, it does not identify exactly between which two groups the difference lies. To do this, multiple group comparison needs to be followed up by an appropriate post hoc test. An example is the Tukey's honestly significant difference test following ANOVA. If the assumptions for parametric tests are not met, there are nonparametric alternatives for comparing data sets. These include Mann-Whitney U-test as the nonparametric counterpart of the unpaired Student's t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test as the counterpart of the paired Student's t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test as the nonparametric equivalent of ANOVA and the Friedman's test as the counterpart of repeated measures ANOVA.},

abstract = {The jump squat is one of the exercises most frequently used to improve lower body power production, which influences sports performance. However, the traditional determination of the specific workload at which power production is maximized (i.e., optimum power load) is time-consuming and requires one-repetition maximum tests. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify whether elite athletes from different sports would produce maximum mean propulsive power values at a narrow range of mean propulsive velocities, resulting in similar jump heights. One hundred and nine elite athletes from several individual/team sport disciplines underwent repetitions at maximal velocity with progressive loads, starting at 40{\%} of their body mass with increments of 10{\%} to determine the individual optimum power zone. Results indicated that regardless of sport discipline, the athletes' optimum mean propulsive power was achieved at a mean propulsive velocity close to 1.0 m.s-1 (1.01 ± 0.07 m.s-1) and at a jump height close to 20 cm (20.47 ± 1.42 cm). Data were narrowly scattered around these values. Therefore, jump squat optimum power load can be determined simply by means of mean propulsive velocity or jump height determination in training/testing settings, allowing it to be implemented quickly in strength/power training.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The influence of various loads on power output in the jump squat (JS), squat (S), and power clean (PC) was examined to determine the load that maximizes power output in each lift. METHODS: Twelve Division I male athletes participated in four testing sessions. The first session involved performing one-repetition maximums (1RM) in the S and PC, followed by three randomized testing sessions involving either the JS, S, or PC. Peak force, velocity, and power were calculated across loads of 0, 12, 27, 42, 56, 71, and 85{\%} of each subject's 1RM in the JS and S and at 10{\%} intervals from 30 to 90{\%} of each subject's 1RM in the PC. RESULTS: The optimal load for the JS was 0{\%} of 1RM; absolute peak power was significantly lower from the optimal load at 42, 56, 71, and 85{\%} of 1RM (P ≤ 0.05), whereas peak power relative to body mass was significantly lower at 27{\%} of 1RM in addition to 42, 56, 71, and 85{\%} of 1RM. Peak power in the S was maximized at 56{\%} of 1RM; however, power was not significantly different across the loading spectrum. The optimal load in the PC occurred at 80{\%} of 1RM. Relative peak power at 80{\%} of 1RM was significantly different from the 30 and 40{\%} of 1RM. CONCLUSION: This investigation indicates that the optimal load for maximal power output occurs at various percentages of 1RM in the JS, S, and PC. {\textcopyright}2007The American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {The load that maximizes mechanical power output (Pmax) has received considerable research attention owing to its perceived importance to training prescription. However, it may be that identifying Pmax is of little importance if the difference in power output about Pmax is insubstantial. Additionally, comparing the effect of load on power output between studies is problematic due to various methodological differences. The purpose of this study therefore was to quantify the concentric power output for a machine squat-jump across a spectrum of loads (10-100{\%} of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]). To estimate Pmax load and proximate loads a quadratic was fitted to the power output (Watts) and load ({\%} of 1RM) of 18 well-trained rugby athletes. Pmax for peak and mean power output occurred at 21.6 ± 7.1{\%} of 1RM (mean ± SD) and 39.0 ± 8.6{\%} of 1RM, respectively. A 20{\%} change in load either side of the maximum resulted in a mean decrease of only 9.9{\%} (90{\%} confidence limits ±2.4{\%}) and 5.4{\%} (±0.9{\%}) in peak and mean power respectively; standard deviations about these means (representing individual differences in the decrease) were 6.0{\%} and 2.1{\%}, respectively (90{\%} confidence limits ×/÷1.34). It appears that most athletes have a broad peak in their power profile for peak or mean power.

abstract = {From a cycling paradigm, little has been done to understand the relationships between maximal isometric strength of different single joint lower body muscle groups and their relation with, and ability to predict PPO and how they compare to an isometric cycling specific task. The aim of this study was to establish relationships between maximal voluntary torque production from isometric single-joint and cycling specific tasks and assess their ability to predict PPO. Twenty male trained cyclists participated in this study. Peak torque was measured by performing maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) of knee extensors, knee flexors, dorsi flexors and hip extensors whilst instrumented cranks measured isometric peak torque from MVC when participants were in their cycling specific position (ISOCYC). A stepwise regression showed that peak torque of the knee extensors was the only significant predictor of PPO when using SJD and accounted for 47{\%} of the variance. However, when compared to ISOCYC, the only significant predictor of PPO was ISOCYC, which accounted for 77{\%} of the variance. This suggests that peak torque of the knee extensors was the best single-joint predictor of PPO in sprint cycling. Furthermore, a stronger prediction can be made from a task specific isometric task.},

In both cases, although the dynamics of the bicycle drive system may have an influence on the results, a thorough understanding of the dynamics has not been developed. This study pursued three objectives related to developing such an understanding. The first was to identify the limitations of the inertial/frictional drive system model commonly used in the literature. The second was to investigate the advantages of an inertial/frictional/compliant model. The final objective was to use these models to develop a methodology for configuring a laboratory ergometer to emulate the drive system dynamics of road riding. Experimental data collected from the resulting road-riding emulator and from a standard ergometer confirmed that the inertial/frictional model is adequate for most studies of road-riding mechanics or pedaling coordination. However, the compliant model was needed to reproduce the phase shift in crank angle variations observed experimentally when emulating the high inertia of road riding. This finding may be significant for equipment setup and design studies where crank kinematic variations are important or for motor control studies where fine control issues are of interest.},

However, slow mitochondrial dynamics, long transit times, complex respiratory control mechanisms, and high breath-by-breath variability obscure the relationship between the body's instantaneous energy demands (instantaneous energetic cost) and that measured from respiratory gases (measured energetic cost). The purpose of this study was to expand on traditional methods of assessing metabolic cost by estimating instantaneous energetic cost during non-steady-state conditions. To accomplish this goal, we first imposed known changes in energy use (input), while measuring the breath-by-breath response (output). We used these input/output relationships to model the body as a dynamic system that maps instantaneous to measured energetic cost. We found that a first-order linear differential equation well approximates transient energetic cost responses during gait. Across all subjects, model fits were parameterized by an average time constant ($\rho$) of 42 - 12 s with an average R2 of 0.94 - 0.05 (mean - SD). Armed with this input/output model, we next tested whether we could use it to reliably estimate instantaneous energetic cost from breath-by-breath measures under conditions that simulated dynamically changing gait. A comparison of the imposed energetic cost profiles and our estimated instantaneous cost demonstrated a close correspondence, supporting the use of our methodology to study the role of energetics during locomotor adaptation and learning.},

abstract = {The importance of aerodynamics in cycling is not a recent discovery. Already in the late 1800s it was recognized as a main source of resistance in cycling. This knowledge was only rediscovered in the late 1970s and 1980s, when aerodynamic concepts were applied to bicycle equipment and cyclist positions, leading to new world hour records and Olympic medals. The renewed interest for cycling aerodynamics is significantly growing with the production of a vast literature, focused on increasing the comprehension of cycling aerodynamics and on improving the aerodynamics of bicycle equipment. Finding the connection between the different subfields of cycling aerodynamics and linking new research with past discoveries is crucial to efficiently drive future studies. Therefore, the present paper provides a comprehensive review of the history and the state-of-the-art in cycling aerodynamics, focusing on one of its main aspects: the bicycle. First, a short history of the bicycle is presented. Next, some cycling power models are outlined and assessment methods for aerodynamic drag are discussed, along with their main advantages and disadvantages. The core of this review paper addresses the components constituting the bicycle: frame and tubes, wheels, handlebar and other equipment. Finally, some future perspectives on bicycle aerodynamics are provided.},

This would in part explain why a bicycle is stable. An experiment was performed to determine weather or not the steering angle is proportional to the lean. Due to noisy data, the proportionality was not conclusively verified, but evidence does suggest that the steer angle is proportional to the lean angle for small angles. The constant of proportionality was determined to be k=2.40{\~{A}}{\^{A}}±0.15. Improvements for future versions of this investigation are suggested.},

abstract = {Aim. The aim of this study was to compare the maximal power output (PO peak) and force-velocity relationships in sprint cycling obtained from a laboratory protocol and from a field test during actual cycling locomotion. Methods. Seven male competitive cyclists performed 6 sprints (3 in the seated position and 3 in the standing position) on an ergotrainer (Tacx, Netherlands) and 6 sprints during actual cycling locomotion in a gymnasium. The bicycle was equipped with the SRM Training System (Schoberer Rad Messtechnik, Germany) to measure (200 Hz) the power output (PO, W), the pedalling cadence (rpm), and the velocity (km {\textperiodcentered} h-1). From these measurements, the maximal force on the pedal (Fmax,N) the theoretical maximal force (F0, N) and the theoretical maximal pedalling cadence (V 0, rpm) were determined. During each sprint test the lateral bicycle oscillations were measured from a video analysis. Results. During standing and seated sprints in the gymnasium, F0 and Fmax were significantly higher (p{\textless}0.05) compared with sprints on the ergo-trainer (+12{\%} and +32{\%}, respectively). The POpeak during sprints in seated and standing positions in the gymnasium was significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower (-4{\%}) and higher (+6{\%}) respectively, compared with the ergo-trainer. For standing position in the gymnasium the kinematics analysis indicated a 24° mean lateral bicycle oscillation compared with 0° on the ergo trainer. Conclusion. The results of this study indicate that POpeak, F 0, and time to obtain POpeak were different between laboratory and actual cycling conditions. To obtain a valid estimation of the maximal power output, it is necessary to perform sprint tests during actual cycling locomotion. Thus, in the laboratory, it is advisable to use a cycle ergometer that enables natural lateral oscillations.},

These protocols are succinctly presented: corrected peak power protocol, force-speed test during repeated all-out sprints against different loads, torque–velocity relationship during a single all-out sprint. The different calibration procedures (static, dynamic, and physiological calibrations) of friction-loaded ergometers are described before the presentation of their results in the literature.

abstract = {CONTEXT: Resistance training while using an instability-training device is known to increase activation of stabilizing muscle groups while decreasing the force generated by the prime movers during isometric contractions. Purpose: To investigate differences in squat kinetics during dynamic resistance training in an increasingly unstable training environment. METHODS: Fourteen active men participated in this study. In each testing session, each participant performed 3 repetitions of squats with a 10-repetition maximum (10-RM) resistance, 40{\%} of their 10-RM resistance, and 20.45 kg. The 3 testing session consisted of standing on a stable floor, foam pads, or BOSU balls. All repetitions were recorded with an optical encoder to record barbell kinetics. RESULTS: The transition from stable (floor) to very unstable (BOSU) resulted in high likelihoods ({\textgreater}75{\%}) of clinically meaningful differences ranging from small to large (effect size [ES] 0.31-1.73) in factors relating to concentric kinetics, eccentric power, and squat depth, regardless of the resistance used for training. There were also likely differences at the heaviest resistance in peak concentric power (stable to foam: ES 2.06; foam to BOSU: ES 0.38), eccentric power (stable to foam: ES 1.88; foam to BOSU: ES 0.74), and squat depth (stable to foam: ES 0.50; foam to BOSU: ES 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training in an unstable environment at an intensity sufficient to elicit strength gains of the prime movers results in deleterious effects in concentric squat kinetics and squat technique. Such observations are particularly evident on very unstable platforms.},

abstract = {The paper defines the term coordination interval (CI), suggesting that is should replace the term electromechanical delay (EMD), if this parameter is determined in vivo for a muscle functioning in a biomechanical system with considerable mobility, but not in a kinematic pair with one degree of rotational freedom (DOF). It was adopted that CI is the time elapsing between the moment of exertion of the resultant muscular force to the surroundings by the ending of the biokinematic chain with many DOFs, and the onset of myopotential in the muscle involved in its actuation. Tested at the same time was the utility efficiency of the system: man-unstable external object with adjustable mobility, as well as the participation and coordination patterns of the upper extremity muscles engaged in stabilizing and motor activities. Twelve adult men, students of physical education, took part in the experiment. The experimental set-up was in the form of a 3.08 m long physical pendulum with the inertial moment of 574 kg m2 and with an exchangeable ending that served as a handle. Three endings were used with zero, one or two DOFs in relation to the pendulum shaft. The subjects of the test were told to push the pendulum ending with maximum force using the upper extremity, so as to impart to it the highest possible kinetic energy, irrespective of its stability type and mobility. The muscles straightening the upper extremity and stabilizing the wrist joint were tested in the EMG measurements. As a result of the experiment, it was found that (1) the utility efficiency of the organism in relation to the force and muscular power exerted on the surroundings decreases to 80 and 60{\%}, respectively, if a driven object requires stabilization, and (2) the patterns of muscular synergism expressed by sequences and frequencies of muscular activation by the nervous system, on the grounds of CI, undergo characteristic changes if a driven object becomes unstable. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of an unstable condition on power, force, and velocity outputs during the bench press. Twenty male collegiate athletes (mean age, 21.3 ± 1.5 years; mean height, 167.7 ±7.7 cm; mean weight, 75.9 ± 17.5 kg) participated in this study. Each subject attempted 3 sets of single bench presses with 50{\%} of 1repetition maximum (1RM) under a stable condition with a flat bench and an unstable condition with a Swiss ball. Acceleration data were obtained with an accelerometer attached to the center of a barbell shaft, and peak outputs of power, force, and velocity were computed. Although significant loss of the peak outputs was found under the unstable condition (p {\textless} 0.017), their reduction rates remained relatively low, approximately 6{\%} for force and 10{\%} for power and velocity outputs, compared with previous findings. Such small reduction rates of muscular outputs may not compromise the training effect.

The stable and unstable sets were performed on different days. Muscular outputs were obtained from a linear encoder and a strain gauge fixed to a vest. [Results] Overall, the results showed no significant differences for any of the dependent variables across exercise modes. Forcemean outputs were higher in the concentric phase than in the eccentric phase for each condition, but there were no differences in velocity, time or displacement. The forcepeak was similar in the eccentric and concentric phases of movement under both stable and unstable conditions. There were no significant differences in forcemean between sets per condition or between conditions.

abstract = {The importance of function of the central core of the body for stabilisation and force generation in all sports activities is being increasingly recognised. 'Core stability' is seen as being pivotal for efficient biomechanical function to maximise force generation and minimise joint loads in all types of activities ranging from running to throwing. However, there is less clarity about what exactly constitutes 'the core', either anatomically or physiologically, and physical evaluation of core function is also variable. 'Core stability' is defined as the ability to control the position and motion of the trunk over the pelvis to allow optimum production, transfer and control of force and motion to the terminal segment in integrated athletic activities. Core muscle activity is best understood as the pre-programmed integration of local, single-joint muscles and multi-joint muscles to provide stability and produce motion. This results in proximal stability for distal mobility, a proximal to distal patterning of generation of force, and the creation of interactive moments that move and protect distal joints. Evaluation of the core should be dynamic, and include evaluation of the specific functions (trunk control over the planted leg) and directions of motions (three-planar activity). Rehabilitation should include the restoring of the core itself, but also include the core as the base for extremity function.},

abstract = {The effect of temperature on skeletal muscle ATP turnover and muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) was studied during maximal power output development in humans. Eight male subjects performed a 6-s maximal sprint on a mechanically braked cycle ergometer under conditions of normal (N) and elevated muscle temperature (ET). Muscle temperature was passively elevated through the combination of hot water immersion and electric blankets. Anaerobic ATP turnover was calculated from analysis of muscle biopsies obtained before and immediately after exercise. MFCV was measured during exercise using surface electromyography. Preexercise muscle temperature was 34.2°C (SD 0.6) in N and 37.5°C (SD 0.6) in ET. During ET, the rate of ATP turnover for phosphocreatine utilization [temperature coefficient (Q10) = 3.8], glycolysis (Q10 = 1.7), and total anaerobic ATP turnover [Q 10 = 2.7; 10.8 (SD 1.9) vs. 14.6 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 (dry mass){\textperiodcentered}s-1 (SD 2.3)] were greater than during N (P {\textless} 0.05). MFCV was also greater in ET than in N [3.79 (SD 0.47) to 5.55 m/s (SD 0.72)]. Maximal power output (Q10 = 2.2) and pedal rate (Q10 = 1.6) were greater in ET compared with N (P {\textless} 0.05). The Q10 of maximal and mean power were correlated (P {\textless} 0.05; R = 0.82 and 0.85, respectively) with the percentage of myosin heavy chain type IIA. The greater power output obtained with passive heating was achieved through an elevated rate of anaerobic ATP turnover and MFCV, possibly due to a greater effect of temperature on power production of fibers, with a predominance of myosin heavy chain IIA at the contraction frequencies reached.

abstract = {In order to utilize static posturography as a tool with which to diagnose pathological balance disorders, it is necessary to understand the contribution of psychological factors such as fear of falling. In this study we examined kinetic and kinematic parameters during quiet stance of eight young healthy adults standing under three conditions which posed increasing levels of postural threat. Participants were required to stand quietly, both with and without visual information and with normal or reduced vestibular information for 2-min periods at each of three surface conditions: ground level (low threat), 81 cm above the ground completely surrounded by a support surface (medium threat) and 81 cm above ground at the edge of the surface (high threat). In addition to calculating displacement and frequency measures for movements of centre of pressure (COP) and centre of mass (COM), a measure of stiffness was derived from the difference between COP-COM signal. Mean EMG activity was recorded bilaterally from anterior and posterior muscles of the lower and upper leg. A stiffening strategy was adopted when individuals stood under high threat conditions involving significant changes in kinematic, kinetic and EMG variables. The A-P stiffness constant increased significantly (27.5{\%}) for the high threat compared to low threat condition, independent of vision or vestibular information. Changes in stiffness were accompanied by: (1) backward shift of the mean A-P position of COP and COM, (2) increased mean power frequency and decreased amplitude displacement of the COP and (3) decreased amplitude displacements of the COM. Of the significant changes observed in mean EMG activity with increased postural threat, only tibialis anterior was significantly correlated with increased stiffness, while activity in soleus, medial gastrocnemius and rectus femoris was highly correlated with mean position of COP.},

abstract = {Human walking has previously been described as "controlled falling." Some computational models, however, suggest that gait may also have self-stabilizing aspects requiring little CNS control. The fore-aft component of walking may even be passively stable from step to step, whereas lateral motion may be unstable and require motor control for balance, as through active foot placement. If this is the case, walking humans might rely less on integrative sensory feedback, such as vision, for anteroposterior (AP) than for mediolateral (ML) balance. We tested whether healthy humans (n = 10) exhibit such direction-dependent control, by applying low-frequency perturbations to the visual field (a projected virtual hallway) and measuring foot placement during treadmill walking. We found step variability to be nearly 10 times more sensitive to ML than to AP perturbations, as quantified by the increase in root-mean-square step variability per unit change in perturbation amplitude. This is not simply due to poorer physiological sensitivity of vision in the AP direction: similar perturbations applied to quiet standing produced reversed direction dependence, with an AP sensitivity 2.3-fold greater than that of ML. Tandem (heel-to-toe) standing yielded ML sensitivity threefold greater than that of AP, suggesting that the base of support influences the stability of standing. Postural balance nevertheless appears to require continuous, integrative motor control for balance in all directions. In contrast, walking balance requires step-by-step, integrative control for balance, but mainly in the lateral direction. In the fore-aft direction, balance may be maintained through an "uncontrolled," yet passively stabilized, series of falls. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Voluntary pushing or translation perturbation of the support surface each induces a body perturbation that affects postural control. The objective of the study was to investigate anticipatory (APA) and compensatory (CPA) postural adjustments when pushing an object (that induces self-initiated perturbation) and standing on a sliding board (that induces translational perturbation). Thirteen healthy young participants were instructed to push a handle with both hands while standing on a sliding board that was either free to move in the anterior–posterior direction or stationary. Electromyographic activity (EMG) of trunk and lower extremity muscles, center of pressure (COP) displacements, and the forces exerted by the hand were recorded and analyzed during the APA and CPA phases. When the sliding board was free to move during pushing (translation perturbation), onsets of activity of ventral leg muscles and COP displacement were delayed as compared to pushing when standing on a stationary board. Moreover, magnitudes of shank muscle activity and the COP displacement were decreased. When pushing heavier weight, magnitudes of muscle activity, COP displacement, and pushing force increased. The magnitude of activity of the shank muscles during the APA and CPA phases in conditions with translational perturbation varied with the magnitude of the pushing weight. The outcome of the study suggests that the central nervous system prioritizes the pushing task while attenuates the source of additional perturbation induced by translation perturbation. These results could be used in the development of balance re-training paradigms involving pushing weight while standing on a sliding surface.},

abstract = {This study explored the directional specificity of fear of falling (FoF) effects on the stabilizing function of anticipatory postural adjustments (APA). Participants (N = 71) performed a series of lateral leg raises from an elevated surface in three conditions: in the “Control condition”, participants stood at the middle of the surface; in the two test conditions, participants were positioned at the lateral edge of the surface so that the shift of the whole-body centre-of-mass during APA for leg raising was directed towards the edge (“Approach condition”) or was directed away from the edge (“Avoidance condition”). Results showed that the amplitude of APA was lower in the “Approach condition” than in the “Control condition” (p {\textless} .01); this reduction was compensated for by an increase in APA duration (p {\textless} .05), so that both postural stability and motor performance (in terms of peak leg velocity, final leg posture and movement duration) remained unchanged. These changes in APA parameters were not present in the “Avoidance condition”. Participants further self-reported a greater FoF (p {\textless} .001) and a lower ability to avoid a fall (p {\textless} .001) in the “Approach condition” (but not in the “Avoidance condition”) than in the “Control condition”. The results of this study show that the effects of FoF do not solely depend on initial environmental conditions, but also on the direction of APA relative to the location of the postural threat. These results support the so-called Motivational Direction Hypothesis, according to which approach and avoidance behaviours are primed by emotional state.},

abstract = {Lateral balance is a critical factor in keeping the human body upright during walking. Two important mechanisms for balance control are the stepping strategy, in which the foot placement is changed in the direction of a sensed fall to modulate how the gravitational force acts on the body, and the lateral ankle strategy, in which the body mass is actively accelerated by an ankle torque. Currently, there is minimal evidence about how these two strategies complement one another to achieve upright balance during locomotion. We use Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to induce the sensation of a fall at heel-off during gait initiation. We found that young healthy adults respond to the illusory fall using both the lateral ankle strategy and the stepping strategy. The stance foot center of pressure (CoP) is shifted in the direction of the perceived fall by ∼2.5 mm, starting ∼247 ms after stimulus onset. The foot placement of the following step is shifted by ∼15 mm in the same direction. The temporal delay between these two mechanisms suggests that they independently contribute to upright balance during locomotion, potentially in a serially coordinated manner. Modeling results indicate that without the lateral ankle strategy, a much larger step width is required to maintain upright balance, suggesting that the small but early CoP shift induced by the lateral ankle strategy is critical for upright stability during locomotion. The relative importance of each mechanism and how neurological disorders may affect their implementation remain an open question. Copyright:},

abstract = {Walking appears to be passively unstable in the lateral direction, requiring active feedback control for stability. The central nervous system may control stability by adjusting medio-lateral foot placement, but potentially with a metabolic cost. This cost increases with narrow steps and may affect the preferred step width. We hypothesized that external stabilization of the body would reduce the active control needed, thereby decreasing metabolic cost and preferred step width. To test these hypotheses, we provided external lateral stabilization, using springs pulling bilaterally from the waist, to human subjects walking on a force treadmill at 1.25m/s. Ten subjects walked, with and without stabilization, at a prescribed step width of zero and also at their preferred step width. We measured metabolic cost using indirect calorimetry, and step width from force treadmill data. We found that at the prescribed zero step width, external stabilization resulted in a 33{\%} decrease in step width variability (root-mean-square) and a 9.2{\%} decrease in metabolic cost. In the preferred step width conditions, external stabilization caused subjects to prefer a 47{\%} narrower step width, with a 32{\%} decrease in step width variability and a 5.7{\%} decrease in metabolic cost. These results suggest that (a) human walking requires active lateral stabilization, (b) body lateral motion is partially stabilized via medio-lateral foot placement, (c) active stabilization exacts a modest metabolic cost, and (d) humans avoid narrow step widths because they are less stable. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Balance control during walking has been shown to involve a metabolic cost in healthy subjects, but it is unclear how this cost changes as a function of postural threat. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of postural threat on the energy cost of walking, as well as on concomitant changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters, muscle activity and perturbation responses. In addition, we examined if and how these effects are dependent on walking speed. Methods. Healthy subjects walked on a treadmill under four conditions of varying postural threat. Each condition was performed at 7 walking speeds ranging from 60-140{\%} of preferred speed. Postural threat was induced by applying unexpected sideward pulls to the pelvis and varied experimentally by manipulating the width of the path subjects had to walk on. Results: Results showed that the energy cost of walking increased by 6-13{\%} in the two conditions with the largest postural threat. This increase in metabolic demand was accompanied by adaptations in spatiotemporal gait parameters and increases in muscle activity, which likely served to arm the participants against a potential loss of balance in the face of the postural threat. Perturbation responses exhibited a slower rate of recovery in high threat conditions, probably reflecting a change in strategy to cope with the imposed constraints. The observed changes occurred independent of changes in walking speed, suggesting that walking speed is not a major determinant influencing gait stability in healthy young adults. Conclusions: The current study shows that in healthy adults, increasing postural threat leads to a decrease in gait economy, independent of walking speed. This could be an important factor in the elevated energy costs of pathological gait. {\textcopyright} 2014 IJmker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {One of the great challenges in the development of passive dynamic walking robots (useful for an understanding of human gait and for future applications in entertainment and the like) is the stabilization of three-dimensional motions. This is a difficult problem due to the inherent interaction between fore-aft motions and sideways motions. In this paper we propose a simple solution. Conceptually, one can avert a sideways fall by steering in that direction, similar to skateboards and bicycles. We propose to implement this concept for walking robots by the introduction of an ankle joint that kinematically couples lean to yaw. The ankle joint has an unusual orientation; its axis points forward and downward, without any left-right component. The effect of the ankle joint is investigated in a simple three-dimensional model with three internal degrees of freedom: one at the hip and two at the ankles. It has cylindric feet and an actuator at the hip joint, which quickly moves the swing leg to a preset forward position. The simulations show that it is easy to find a stable configuration, and that the resultant walking motion is highly robust to disturbances. Similar to skateboards and bicycles, there exists a critical velocity (as a function of the parameters) above which stable walking motions occur. The critical velocity can be lower for a more vertical ankle axis orientation. As an additional benefit, the ankle joint allows a straightforward implementation for steering; a simple sideways offset of the mass distribution will cause the model to gently steer in that direction. The results show great potential for the construction of a real-world prototype with the proposed ankle joint. {\textcopyright}2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deficits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deficits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies},

abstract = {We measured variability of foot placement during gait to test whether lateral balance must be actively controlled against dynamic instability. The hypothesis was developed using a simple dynamical model that can walk down a slight incline with a periodic gait resembling that of humans. This gait is entirely passive except that it requires active control for a single unstable mode, confined mainly to lateral motion. An especially efficient means of controlling this instability is to adjust lateral foot placement. We hypothesized that similar active feedback control is performed by humans, with fore-aft dynamics stabilized either passively or by very low-level control. The model predicts that uncertainty within the active feedback loop should result in variability in foot placement that is larger laterally than fore-aft. In addition, loss of sensory information such as by closing the eyes should result in larger increases in lateral variability. The control model also predicts a slight coupling between step width and length. We tested 15 young normal human subjects and found that lateral variability was 79{\%} larger than fore-aft variability with eyes open, and a larger increase in lateral variability (53{\%} vs. 21{\%}) with eyes closed, consistent with the model's predictions. We also found that the coupling between lateral and fore-aft foot placements was consistent with a value of 0.13 predicted by the control model. Our results imply that humans may harness passive dynamic properties of the limbs in the sagittal plane, but must provide significant active control in order to stabilize lateral motion.

abstract = {Research on how human balance and control bicycles are inconclusive, largely due to the small number of participants in the previous studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that 1) cycling lateral deviation amplitude will reliably show differences between more and less experienced cyclists and 2) more experienced will exhibit slower and smaller steering motions compared to the less experienced cyclists. Twenty-eight experienced and inexperienced cyclists rode a bicycle in a straight line. Lateral deviation, steering and roll were measured. Intersession reliability of the deviation was high with Cronbach's alpha values higher than 0.75. The amplitude, variability and rate of steering and roll parameters showed statistically significant differences between the groups. The test used in this study is sensitive to detect differences between more and less experienced cyclists and can be used for further research that aims to test the effect of a specific intervention addressing rider control. We also showed that steering and roll angle, which were described before as two of the main motor control actions in bicycle control, differ in the variability, amplitude and rate between more and less experienced cyclists. The results of the present study have practical implications for improving bicycle rider control and increasing the safety of cyclists.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was compare the effects of a traditional and an instability resistance circuit training program on upper and lower limb strength, power, movement velocity and jumping ability. Thirty-six healthy untrained men were assigned to two experimental groups and a control group. Subjects in the experimental groups performed a resistance circuit training program consisting of traditional exercises (TRT, n = 10) or exercises executed in conditions of instability (using BOSU{\textregistered} and TRX{\textregistered}) (IRT, n = 12). Both programs involved three days per week of training for a total of seven weeks. The following variables were determined before and after training: maximal strength (1RM), average (AV) and peak velocity (PV), average (AP) and peak power (PP), all during bench press (BP) and back squat (BS) exercises, along with squat jump (SJ) height and counter movement jump (CMJ) height. All variables were found to significantly improve (p {\textless}0.05) in response to both training programs. Major improvements were observed in SJ height (IRT = 22.1{\%}, TRT = 20.1{\%}), CMJ height (IRT = 17.7{\%}, TRT = 15.2{\%}), 1RM in BS (IRT = 13.03{\%}, TRT = 12.6{\%}), 1RM in BP (IRT = 4.7{\%}, TRT = 4.4{\%}), AP in BS (IRT = 10.5{\%}, TRT = 9.3{\%}), AP in BP (IRT = 2.4{\%}, TRT = 8.1{\%}), PP in BS (IRT=19.42{\%}, TRT = 22.3{\%}), PP in BP (IRT = 7.6{\%}, TRT = 11.5{\%}), AV in BS (IRT = 10.5{\%}, TRT = 9.4{\%}), and PV in BS (IRT = 8.6{\%}, TRT = 4.5{\%}). Despite such improvements no significant differences were detected in the posttraining variables recorded for the two experimental groups. These data indicate that a circuit training program using two instability training devices is as effective in untrained men as a program executed under stable conditions for improving strength (1RM), power, movement velocity and jumping ability. {\textcopyright} Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE WHILE THE POPULARITY OF INSTABILITY RESISTANCE TRAINING (RESISTANCE TRAINING THAT INVOLVES THE USE OF UNSTABLE SURFACES AND DEVICES: IRT) is evident in fitness training facilities, its effectiveness for optimal sport performance training has been questioned. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to explore the resistance training literature, which implements the use of unstable surfaces and devices to determine the suitability of IRT for rehabilitation. DESCRIPTION OF TOPIC AND RELATED EVIDENCE The criticism of IRT for athletic conditioning is based on the findings of impaired kinetic measures such as force, power and movement velocity during a bout of IRT compared to traditional resistance training with more stable surfaces or devices. However, these deficits occur concurrently with minimal changes or in some cases increases in trunk and limb muscle activation. Compared to the kinetic deficits that are reported during unstable resistance exercises, the relatively greater trunk muscle activation indicates a greater stabilizing function for the muscles. IRT exercises can also provide training adaptations for coordination and other motor control issues, which may be more important for low back pain rehabilitation than strength or power enhancements. RELATION TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Improvements in postural stability from balance training without resistance can improve force output which can then lead to a training progression involving an amalgamation of balance and IRT leading to higher load traditional resistance training.},

abstract = {Purpose: It is unknown whether maximal voluntary co-contraction of abdominal muscles, called abdominal bracing, can be a training maneuver for improving strength and power of trunk and lower limb muscles. The present study aimed to elucidate this. Methods: Twenty young adult men (23.3 ± 1.8 years) were allocated to training (TG, n = 11) or control (CG, n = 9) group. TG conducted an 8-week training program (3 days/week) consisting of 2-s maximal abdominal bracing followed by 2-s muscle relaxation (5 × 10 repetitions/day). Maximal voluntary isometric strength during trunk flexion and extension, hip extension, and knee extension, maximal lifting power from sitting position, and the thicknesses of abdominal muscles were measured before and after the intervention. In addition, surface electromyograms from trunk and lower limb muscles and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during the maximal abdominal bracing and maximal lifting tasks were also determined. Results: After the intervention, TG showed significant increases in isometric trunk extension (+14.4 {\%}) and hip extension (+34.7 {\%}) strength and maximal lifting power (+15.6 {\%}), while CG did not show any changes in strength and power variables. Furthermore, TG had significant gains in the muscle thickness of the oblique internal (+22.4 {\%}), maximal IAP during abdominal bracing (+36.8 {\%}), and the rate of IAP rise during lifting task (+58.8 {\%}), without corresponding changes in CG.

Eight male subjects performed unilateral leg extensor (LE) and PF contractions while seated on a bench (LE), chair (PF), or a ball. Unstable LE and PF forces were 70.5 and 200.2{\%} less than their stable counterparts, respectively. Unstable quadriceps and PF activation averaged 44.3 and 2.9{\%} less than activation under stable conditions. Unstable antagonist/agonist ratios were 400.2 and 300.7{\%} greater than stable ratios in the LE and PF protocols, respectively. The greater decrements with LE can be attributed to the instability of only 2 points of floor contact, rather than 3 points of floor contact as with the PF. Swiss balls may permit a strength training adaptation of the limbs, if instability is moderate, allowing the production of overload forces.},

abstract = {The metabolic cost of walking is determined by many mechanical tasks, but the individual contribution of each task remains unclear. We hypothesized that the force generated to support body weight and the work performed to redirect and accelerate body mass each individually incur a significant metabolic cost during normal walking. To test our hypothesis, we measured changes in metabolic rate in response to combinations of simulated reduced gravity and added loading. We found that reducing body weight by simulating reduced gravity modestly decreased net metabolic rate. By calculating the metabolic cost per Newton of reduced body weight, we deduced that generating force to support body weight comprises ∼28{\%} of the metabolic cost of normal walking. Similar to previous loading studies, we found that adding both weight and mass increased net metabolic rate in more than direct proportion to load. However, when we added mass alone by using a combination of simulated reduced gravity and added load, net metabolic rate increased about one-half as much as when we added both weight and mass. By calculating the cost per kilogram of added mass, we deduced that the work performed on the center of mass comprises ∼45{\%} of the metabolic cost of normal walking. Our findings support the hypothesis that force and work each incur a significant metabolic cost. Specifically, the cost of performing work to redirect and accelerate the center of mass is almost twice as great as the cost of generating force to support body weight.},

abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95{\%} confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

abstract = {Hair analysis is emerging as a popular tool to examine stress and reproduction hormone levels in wild mammals. The reliability of this approach, however, depends on an understanding of steroid hormone incorporation into hair as well as appropriate validations. We reviewed studies that have examined steroid hormones in wildlife hair with the goal of summarizing the analytical, physiological, and biological evidence that this approach is meaningful. Accordingly, we differentiated among validations aimed at evaluating the reliability of the analytical method versus those designed to assess whether hormone levels in hair reflect physiologically meaningful processes in the target species. Our literature survey revealed that endogenous steroids have been examined in hair from 40 species of nonhuman animals across seven mammalian classes. Although the majority (85{\%}) of 72 studies reported analytical validations of the method, physiological validations have only been reported for five species. Moreover, results of physiological validations were inconsistent among studies. This highlights the need for further research, carefully designed to differentiate between the multiple purported models of steroid incorporation into hair in species with different types of hair and different hair growth patterns. To complement our review of published studies, we present new data supporting a positive relationship between levels of the steroid, cortisol, in hair and blood across eight mammalian species. In addition, we present novel results from a laboratory-based study showing variable hair growth in genetically identical laboratory mice that were kept under controlled conditions. Synthesis and applications. Collectively, this Review reveals substantial progress towards the validation of stress hormone assays in hair from a variety of wildlife species. Further validations of reproductive steroids, combined with appropriate physiological validations, would expand the potential applications of hair analyses in wildlife research. As a key example, physiological data can provide mechanistic insights into species' responses to change and may therefore contribute to conservation planning.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the influence of seated, standing, and forward-standing cycling sprint positions on aerodynamic drag (CdA) and the reproducibility of a field test of CdA calculated in these different positions. Methods: A total of 11 recreational male road cyclists rode 250 m in 2 directions at around 25, 32, and 40 km{\textperiodcentered}h−1 and in each of the 3 positions, resulting in a total of 18 efforts per participant. Riding velocity, power output, wind direction and velocity, road gradient, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure were measured and used to calculate CdA using regression analysis. Results: A main effect of position showed that the average CdA of the 2 d was lower for the forward-standing position (0.295 [0.059]) compared with both the seated (0.363 [0.071], P = .018) and standing positions (0.372 [0.077], P = .037). Seated and standing positions did not differ from each other. Although no significant difference was observed in CdA between the 2 test days, a poor between-days reliability was observed. Conclusion: A novel forward-standing cycling sprint position resulted in 23{\%} and 26{\%} reductions in CdA compared with a seated and standing position, respectively. This decrease in CdA could potentially result in an important increase in cycling sprint velocity of 3.9–4.9 km{\textperiodcentered}h−1, although these results should be interpreted with caution because poor reliability of CdA was observed between days.},

abstract = {A few riders have adopted a rather exceptional and more aerodynamic sprint position where the torso is held low and nearly horizontal and close to the handle bar to reduce the frontal area. The question arises how much aerodynamic benefit can be gained by such a position. This paper presents an aerodynamic analysis of both the regular and the low sprint position in comparison to three more common cycling positions. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed with the 3D RANS simulations and the transition SST k–$\omega$ model, validated with wind-tunnel measurements. The results are analyzed in terms of frontal area, drag coefficient, drag area, air speed and static pressure distribution, and static pressure coefficient and skin friction coefficient on the cyclist surfaces. It is shown that the drag area for the low sprint position is 24{\%} lower than for the regular position, which renders the former 15{\%} faster than the latter. This 24{\%} improvement is not only the result of the 19{\%} reduction in frontal area, but also caused by a reduction of 7{\%} in drag coefficient due to the changed body position and the related changes in pressure distribution. Evidently, specific training is required to exert large power in the low sprint position.},

Phys. 32 1293) incorrectly assert that two key differences exist between riding a bicycle on pavement and riding on rollers. The first is that riding a bicycle on rollers somehow tests the role of the centrifugal force and the second is that a lack of inertia or forward momentum on rollers somehow decreases stability. The most straightforward explanation for why these differences do not exist is Galilean invariance. Although it is true that the steer and yaw angles, and thus the magnitude of any lateral acceleration, are limited because of the narrow width of a treadmill or rollers, which certainly can make balancing more difficult, the accelerations that do occur are identical to those which would be found by riding within a similarly narrow path of fixed pavement. In fact, even though a bicycle on rollers or a treadmill has no forward momentum in a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the ground, it has the same balance dynamics, and thus stability, as the same bicycle on fixed pavement. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Research investigating biomechanical factors in the sport of cycling is abundant. However, studies isolating on the hill climbing aspect of cycling are less numerous. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of four position/cadence combinations (sit/60 rev.min-1, stand/60 rev.min-1, sit/75 rev.min-1 and stand/75 rcv.min-1) on center of mass displacement, rear hub acceleration and the kinematic characteristics of hill climbing cyclists. The kinematic variables measured included trunk segment angle range and mean, hip joint angle range and mean, knee joint angle range and mean, and ankle joint angle range and mean Fourteen highly trained United States Cycling Federation (USCF) licensed cyclists served as subjects. They were filmed at 60 fps while they rode their own racing bicycles on a motorizcd treadmill at 19 kmhr-1 and 5 46 grade. Each subject rode for 8 minutes in each of the four position/cadence combinations The standing position resulted in a significantly larger rear hub acceleration, center of mass displacement, mean trunk segment angle, and trunk, hip and knee angle range of motion than the sitting position. However, mean trunk, hip, knee, and ankle angles were all significantly greater in the sitting position as eomparcd to the standing position. The ankle angle range of motion was not different between positions. Only center of mass displacement, knee angle range of motion, and mean ankle angle were significantly efl'cctcd by a change in CddenCe. All three variables were significantly larger at the 60 revmin-1 cadence. However, because power outputs were held constant between all treatments and all data was normalized to one pedal revolution the differences between cadences may have resulted from the greater forces applied per cycle at the slower cadence rather than from the difference in angular velocity. It is evident that uphill cycling mechanics am effected more by a change in the riding position than by gear selection. The kinematic analysis implies that the two positions place the lower extremity musculature at different places on their length-tension curves. Assuming that the force required per pedal revolution is equivalent, it appears that the energy expenditure as a result of leg muscle action will differ between the two positions.},

A major challenge in the prevention of falls is the identification of individuals who are at risk of falling owing to an unstable gait. At present, several methods are available for estimating gait stability, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we review the currently available measures: the maximum Lyapunov exponent (lS and lL), the maximum Floquet multiplier, variability measures, long-range correlations, extrapolated centre of mass, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, foot placement estimator, gait sensitivity norm and maximum allowable - perturbation. We explain what these measures represent and how they are calculated, andwe assess their validity, divided up into construct validity, predictive validity in simple models, convergent validity in experimental studies, and predictive validity in observational studies. We conclude that (i) the validity of variability measures and lS is best supported across all levels, (ii) the maximum Floquet multiplier and lL have good construct validity, but negative predictive validity in models, negative convergent validity and (for lL) negative predictive validity in observational studies, (iii) long-range correlations lack construct validity and predictive validity inmodels and have negative convergent validity, and (iv) measures derived from perturbation experiments have good construct validity, but data are lacking on convergent validity in experimental studies and predictive validity in observational studies.

Powered exoskeletons and other assistive devices are sophisticated modern tools that have restored bipedal locomotion in individuals with paraplegia and have endowed unimpaired individuals with superhuman strength. Despite these successes, designing assistive devices that reduce energy consumption during running remains a substantial challenge, in part because these devices disrupt the dynamics of a complex, finely tuned biological system. Furthermore, designers have hitherto relied primarily on experiments, which cannot report muscle-level energy consumption and are fraught with practical challenges. In this study, we use OpenSim to generate muscle-driven simulations of 10 human subjects running at 2 and 5 m/s. We then add ideal, massless assistive devices to our simulations and examine the predicted changes in muscle recruitment patterns and metabolic power consumption. Our simulations suggest that an assistive device should not necessarily apply the net joint moment generated by muscles during unassisted running, and an assistive device can reduce the activity of muscles that do not cross the assisted joint. Our results corroborate and suggest biomechanical explanations for similar effects observed by experimentalists, and can be used to form hypotheses for future experimental studies. The models, simulations, and software used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and can provide insight into assistive device design that complements experimental approaches.},

abstract = {Purpose Our goal was to quantify if small (1{\%}-3{\%}) changes in running economy quantitatively affect distance-running performance. Based on the linear relationship between metabolic rate and running velocity and on earlier observations that added shoe mass increases metabolic rate by 1{\%} per 100 g per shoe, we hypothesized that adding 100 and 300 g per shoe would slow 3000-m time-trial performance by 1{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively. Methods Eighteen male sub-20-min 5-km runners completed treadmill testing, and three 3000-m time trials wearing control shoes and identical shoes with 100 and 300 g of discreetly added mass. We measured rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and calculated metabolic rates for the treadmill tests, and we recorded overall running time for the time trials. Results Adding mass to the shoes significantly increased metabolic rate at 3.5 m{\textperiodcentered}s -1 by 1.11{\%} per 100 g per shoe (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.88{\%}-1.35{\%}). While wearing the control shoes, participants ran the 3000-m time trial in 626.1 ± 55.6 s. Times averaged 0.65{\%} ± 1.36{\%} and 2.37{\%} ± 2.09{\%} slower for the +100-g and +300-g shoes, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). On the basis of a linear fit of all the data, 3000-m time increased 0.78{\%} per added 100 g per shoe (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.52{\%}-1.04{\%}). Conclusion Adding shoe mass predictably degrades running economy and slows 3000-m time-trial performance proportionally. Our data demonstrate that laboratory-based running economy measurements can accurately predict changes in distance-running race performance due to shoe modifications.},

However, how these improvements in running economy (RE) quantitatively translate into faster running performance is less established. Here, we quantify how metabolic savings translate into faster running performance, considering both the inherent rate of oxygen uptake-velocity relation and the additional cost of overcoming air resistance when running overground. We collate and compare five existing equations for oxygen uptake-velocity relations across wide velocity ranges. Because the oxygen uptake vs. velocity relation is non-linear, for velocities slower than ∼3 m/s, the predicted percent improvement in velocity is slightly greater than the percent improvement in RE. For velocities faster than ∼3 m/s, the predicted percent improvement in velocity is less than the percent improvements in RE. At 5.5 m/s, i.e., world-class marathon pace, the predicted percent improvement in velocity is ∼2/3rds of the percent improvement in RE. For example, at 2:04 marathon pace, a 3{\%} improvement in RE translates to a 1.97{\%} faster velocity or 2:01:36, almost exactly equal to the recently set world record.},

abstract = {Objective. According to the literature, 30-70{\%} of cyclists suffer from cervical, dorsal, or lumbar back pain. This study was conducted to evaluate one of the possible causes of low back pain and to suggest a solution by appropriate adjustments to the bicycle. Methods. Serial fluoroscopic studies were performed while cyclists sat on different types of bicycle (sports, mountain, and city). Pelvic/spine angles were measured at different seat angles, and the related force vectors analysed. Results. There was a tendency towards hyperextension of the pelvic/spine angle which resulted in an increase in tensile forces at the promontorium. These forces can easily be reduced by appropriate adjustment of the seat angle - that is, by creating an anterior inclining angle. The findings of the biomechanical analysis were then applied to a group of cyclists who were members of a cycling club and who complained of low back pain. After appropriate adjustment of the saddle angle, most of the cyclists ({\textgreater} 70{\%}) reported major improvement in the incidence and magnitude of their back pain. Conclusions. The incidence and magnitude of back pain in cyclists can be reduced by appropriate adjustment of the angle of the saddle. It is important that these findings be conveyed to cyclists, bicycle salesmen, trainers, and members of the general public who engage in cycling, in order to decrease the prevalence of back pain.},

abstract = {Stiff-knee gait is a troublesome movement disorder among children with cerebral palsy (CP), where peak swing phase knee flexion is diminished due to over-activity of the rectus femoris muscle. A common treatment for stiff-knee gait, rectus femoris transfer surgery, moves the muscle's distal tendon from the patella to the sartorius insertion on the tibia. As a biarticular muscle, rectus femoris may play a role in motor control and have unrecognized benefits for maintaining balance. We used musculoskeletal modeling, neuromuscular control, and forward dynamic simulation to investigate the role of rectus femoris tendon transfer surgery on balance recovery after support-surface perturbations for children with CP adopting two different crouched postures. We combined both high-level supraspinal and low-level spinal signals to generate 92 muscle excitations for tracking experimental whole body center of mass positions and velocities. Stability during balance recovery was evaluated by the minimum distance between the extrapolated center of mass and base of support boundary (bmin) and the minimum time to reach the boundary (TtBmin). The balance recovery of pre-surgical simulations (bmin=2.3+1.1cm, TtBmin=0.2+0.1s) were different (p=0.02), on average, than post-surgical simulations (bmin=-4.9+11.4cm, TtBmin=-0.1+0.3s) of rectus femoris transfers. The moderate crouch simulations (bmin=2.4+0.4cm, TtBmin=0.2+0.03s) were more stable than the mild crouch simulations (bmin=1.2+0.3cm, TtBmin=0.1+0.02s) following anterior translations of the support surface. These findings suggest that tendon transfer of rectus femoris affects balance recovery in children with CP.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations play an important role in solving complex engineering problems and have the potential to revolutionize medical decision making and treatment strategies. In this paper, we combine the rapid model-based design, control systems and powerful numerical method strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with the simulation and human movement dynamics strengths of OpenSim by developing a new interface between the two software tools. OpenSim is integrated with Simulink using the MATLAB S-function mechanism, and the interface is demonstrated using both open-loop and closed-loop control systems. While the open-loop system uses MATLAB/Simulink to separately reproduce the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool, the closed-loop system adds the unique feature of feedback control to OpenSim, which is necessary for most human movement simulations. An arm model example was successfully used in both open-loop and closed-loop cases. For the open-loop case, the simulation reproduced results from the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool with root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.03° for the shoulder elevation angle and 0.06° for the elbow flexion angle. MATLAB's variable step-size integrator reduced the time required to generate the forward dynamic simulation from 7.1. s (OpenSim) to 2.9. s (MATLAB). For the closed-loop case, a proportional-integral-derivative controller was used to successfully balance a pole on model's hand despite random force disturbances on the pole. The new interface presented here not only integrates the OpenSim and MATLAB/Simulink software tools, but also will allow neuroscientists, physiologists, biomechanists, and physical therapists to adapt and generate new solutions as treatments for musculoskeletal conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We previously reported that a mathematical model could accurately predict steady-state road-cycling power when all the model parameters were known. Application of that model to competitive cycling has been limited by the need to obtain accurate parameter values, the non-steady-state nature of many cycling events, and because the validity of the model at maximal power has not been established. Purpose: We determined whether modeling parameters could be accurately determined during field trials and whether the model could accurately predict cycling speed during maximal acceleration using forward integration. Methods: First, we quantified aerodynamic drag area of six cyclists using both wind tunnel and field trials allowing for these two techniques to be compared. Next, we determined the aerodynamic drag area of three world-class sprint cyclists using the field-test protocol. Track cyclists also performed maximal standing-start time trials, during which we recorded power and speed. Finally, we used forward integration to predict cycling speed from power-time data recorded during the maximal trials allowing us to compare predicted speed with measured speed. Results: Field-based values of aerodynamic drag area (0.258 ± 0.006 m2) did not differ (P = 0.53) from those measured in a wind tunnel (0.261 ± 0.006 m2). Forward integration modeling accurately predicted cycling speed (y = x, r2 = 0.989) over the duration of the standing-start sprints. Conclusions: Field-derived values for aerodynamic drag area can be equivalent to values derived from wind tunnel testing, and these values can be used to accurately predict speed even during maximal-power acceleration by world-class sprint cyclists. This model could be useful for assessing aerodynamic issues and for predicting how subtle changes in riding position, mass, or power output will influence cycling speed.

abstract = {Computer modeling, simulation and optimization are powerful tools that have seen increased use in biomechanics research. Dynamic optimizations can be categorized as either data-tracking or predictive problems. The data-tracking approach has been used extensively to address human movement problems of clinical relevance. The predictive approach also holds great promise, but has seen limited use in clinical applications. Enhanced software tools would facilitate the application of predictive musculoskeletal simulations to clinically-relevant research. The open-source software OpenSim provides tools for generating tracking simulations but not predictive simulations. However, OpenSim includes an extensive application programming interface that permits extending its capabilities with scripting languages such as MATLAB. In the work presented here, we combine the computational tools provided by MATLAB with the musculoskeletal modeling capabilities of OpenSim to create a framework for generating predictive simulations of musculoskeletal movement based on direct collocation optimal control techniques. In many cases, the direct collocation approach can be used to solve optimal control problems considerably faster than traditional shooting methods. Cyclical and discrete movement problems were solved using a simple 1 degree of freedom musculoskeletal model and a model of the human lower limb, respectively. The problems could be solved in reasonable amounts of time (several seconds to 1-2 hours) using the open-source IPOPT solver. The problems could also be solved using the fmincon solver that is included with MATLAB, but the computation times were excessively long for all but the smallest of problems. The performance advantage for IPOPTwas derived primarily by exploiting sparsity in the constraints Jacobian. The framework presented here provides a powerful and flexible approach for generating optimal control simulations of musculoskeletal movement using OpenSim and MATLAB. This should allow researchers to more readily use predictive simulation as a tool to address clinical conditions that limit human mobility.},

abstract = {Previous studies in endurance athletes have indicated that block periodization (BP) can be a good alternative to the more traditional organization of training despite the fact that the total volume and intensity of the training are similar. However, these studies usually last only 4-12 wk. The aim of the present single-case study was to investigate the consequences of 58 wk with systematic BP of low-intensity training (LIT), moderate-intensity training (MIT), and high-intensity interval training (HIT) including incorporation of heavy strength training. It is important that a maintenance stimulus on the nonprioritized training modalities was added in the different training blocks. Performance-related variables were tested regularly during the intervention. The studied cyclist started with a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 73.8 mL kg-1 min-1, peak aerobic power (Wmax) of 6.14 W/kg, and a power output at 3 mmol/L blood lactate concentration (Power3la-) of 3.6 W/kg. Total training volume during the 58-wk intervention was 678 h, of which 452 h were LIT (67{\%}), 124 h were MIT (18{\%}), 69 h were HIT (10{\%}), and 34 h were heavy strength training (5{\%}). The weekly training volume had a large range depending on the focus of the training block. After the intervention the cyclist's VO2max was 87 mL kg-1 min-1, Wmax was 7.35 W/kg, and Power3la- was 4.9 W/kg. This single case indicates that the present training program can be a good alternative to the more traditional organization of long-term training of endurance athletes. However, a general recommendation cannot be given based on this single-case study.},

abstract = {Respiratory measures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are routinely used to estimate the body's steady-state metabolic energy use. However, slow mitochondrial dynamics, long transit times, complex respiratory control mechanisms, and high breath-by-breath variability obscure the relationship between the body's instantaneous energy demands (instantaneous energetic cost) and that measured from respiratory gases (measured energetic cost). The purpose of this study was to expand on traditional methods of assessing metabolic cost by estimating instantaneous energetic cost during non-steady-state conditions. To accomplish this goal, we first imposed known changes in energy use (input), while measuring the breath-by-breath response (output). We used these input/output relationships to model the body as a dynamic system that maps instantaneous to measured energetic cost. We found that a first-order linear differential equation well approximates transient energetic cost responses during gait. Across all subjects, model fits were parameterized by an average time constant ($\rho$) of 42 - 12 s with an average R2 of 0.94 - 0.05 (mean - SD). Armed with this input/output model, we next tested whether we could use it to reliably estimate instantaneous energetic cost from breath-by-breath measures under conditions that simulated dynamically changing gait. A comparison of the imposed energetic cost profiles and our estimated instantaneous cost demonstrated a close correspondence, supporting the use of our methodology to study the role of energetics during locomotor adaptation and learning.},

abstract = {Lower extremity robotic prostheses and exoskeletons can require tuning a large number of control parameters on a subject-specific basis to reduce users' metabolic power during locomotion. We refer to the functional relationship between control parameter configurations and users' metabolic power as the metabolic cost landscape. Standard practice for estimating a metabolic cost landscape, and thus identifying optimal parameter configurations, is to vary control parameters while measuring steady-state metabolic power during walking. This approach is time consuming, tedious, and inefficient. We have developed an instantaneous cost mapping analysis that allows for an estimate of the metabolic cost landscape without the explicit need for steady-state measurements. Here we present novel methods to quantify the confidence in an estimated metabolic cost landscape, allowing for an objective subject-specific comparison of protocols regardless of which metabolic analysis is used. We validated these techniques by estimating metabolic cost landscapes for healthy subjects walking with bilateral robotic ankle exoskeletons using a standard practice protocol and two innovative protocols that use an instantaneous cost mapping analysis. All cost landscapes were a function of the devices' actuation timing. Results showed that for this device a protocol using an instantaneous cost mapping analysis could accurately identify optimal parameter configurations in 20 min, where the standard practice protocol required 42 min. Additionally, using an instantaneous cost mapping analysis with the standard practice's parameter exploration significantly improved fit confidence. These methods could greatly improve real-time optimization of robotic assistive devices or studies focused on biomechanical manipulations of locomotion. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY We are presenting novel subject-specific metabolic cost landscape confidence analyses. These confidence analyses can greatly improve experimental design, intersubject analysis, and the comparison of landscape mapping protocols. We validated these methods by mapping subject-specific metabolic cost landscapes using bilateral ankle exoskeletons and are presenting the first full study using instantaneous cost mapping techniques to optimally tune an assistive robotic device.},

In response to this opportunity, recent work on human-in-the-loop optimization has considered the problem of automatically tuning control parameters based on realtime physiological measurements. However, the common use of metabolic cost as a performance metric creates significant experimental challenges due to its long measurement times and low signal-to-noise ratio. We evaluate the use of Bayesian optimization - a family of sample-efficient, noise-tolerant, and global optimization methods - for quickly identifying near-optimal control parameters. To manage experimental complexity and provide comparisons against related work, we consider the task of minimizing metabolic cost by optimizing walking step frequencies in unaided human subjects. Compared to an existing approach based on gradient descent, Bayesian optimization identified a near-optimal step frequency with a faster time to convergence (12 minutes, p {\textless} 0.01), smaller inter-subject variability in convergence time (± 2 minutes, p {\textless} 0.01), and lower overall energy expenditure (p {\textless} 0.01).},

abstract = {To work towards an advanced model of the bicycle-rider-environment system, an open-loop bicycle-rider model was developed in the commercial multibody dynamics software ADAMS. The main contribution of this article to bicycle dynamics is the analysis of tyre and rider properties that influence bicycle stability. A system identification method is used to extract linear stability properties from time domain analysis. The weave and capsize eigenmodes of the bicycle-rider system are analysed. The effect of tyre properties is studied using the tyre's forces and torques that have been measured in several operating conditions. The main result is that extending simplified models with a realistic tyre model leads to a notable decrease in the weave stability and a stabilization of the capsize mode. This effect is mainly caused by the twisting torque. Different tyres and tyre inflation pressures have little effect on the bicycle's stability, in the case of riding straight at a constant forward speed. On the other hand, the tyre load does have a large effect on bicycle stability. The sensitivity study of rider properties shows that body stiffness and damping have a small effect on the weave and capsize mode, whereas arm stiffness destabilizes the capsize mode and arm damping destabilizes the weave mode.},

The visual field of the bike rider is enveloped within a multi-screen visualization environment which provides visual data relative to the motion and activity of the test bicycle. This implies the bike rider has to pedal and steer the bicycle as they would a traditional bicycle, while forward motion is recorded and processed to control the visualization. Furthermore, the platform is fed with real forces and accelerations that have been logged by a mobile data acquisition system during real bicycle test drives. Thus, using a feedback system makes the movements of the platform reflect the virtual environment and the reaction of the driver (e.g. steering angle, step rate). Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal simulations of movement can provide insights needed to help humans regain mobility after injuries and design robots that interact with humans. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation but requires extensive technical expertise to implement. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves, allowing them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle the wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which are common in musculoskeletal models. To show Moco's abilities, we first solve for muscle activity that produces an observed walking motion while minimizing muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Then, we predict a squat-to-stand motion and optimize the stiffness of a passive assistive knee device. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand human and animal movement.},

abstract = {The relationship of maximal anaerobic power (P(max)) of the quadriceps muscle and corresponding optimal shortening velocity (v(opt)) with age, habitual physical activity (PA) and maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)) were assessed in 37 healthy older [71.1 (SD 3.8) years] men and compared to those of 16 young [22.7 (SD 3.4) years] men. The PA was evaluated using a questionnaire. The P(max) and v(opt) were measured on a friction loaded non-isokinetic cycle ergometer. The P(max) was expressed relative to body mass - P(max{\textperiodcentered}kg-1), and relative to the mass of the two quadriceps muscles - P(max{\textperiodcentered}kgquad-1). The decline of P(max{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) from youth to advanced age (8.3{\%} per decade) was greater than the decrease in quadriceps muscle mass (3.8{\%} per decade), in P(max{\textperiodcentered}kgquad-1) (5.9{\%} per decade) and in v(opt) (4.3{\%} per decade). In the older men, a negative relationship of P(max{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) (r = -0.33) and P(max{\textperiodcentered}kgquad-1) (r = -0.44) with age was found. Ergometer measurements were not correlated with PA activity indices or VO(2max), while VO(2max) was positively associated with PA. In a multiple stepwise regression analysis age was the only variable that contributed significantly to P(max{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) and P(max{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) variances. Our findings indicate a that in these healthy elderly men, unlike the fall in VO(2max), habitual PA did not attenuate the decline in P(max) of the quadriceps muscle with age. This finding was different from a previously described relationship in older women and would suggest sex differences in determining P(max) in healthy older subjects.},

An extended Whipple bicycle model is presented which makes uses of a unique set of physical parameters based on cylindrical gyrostats. The nonlinear equations of motion for this model are derived, linearized, and validated against a set of benchmark model parameters. A general formulation for the linearization of a system with configuration and velocity constraints is presented, and is demonstrated on an idealized rolling disk. The method of linearization is directly applicable to the equations of motion which result from the application of Kane's method. The linearization procedure is used to formulate the linear state space equations of motion for the bicycle model, which are then used as the plant model to design the robotic bicycle control system. The mechanical, electrical, and software aspects of the robotic bicycle are presented, along with representative results from a set of experiments.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

LLE men were further subdivided based on intensity of lifelong exercise and competitive status into performance (LLE-P, n 14) and fitness (LLE-F, n 7). On average, LLE exercised 5 day/wk for 7 h/wk over the past 52 1 yr. Each subject performed a maximal cycle test to assess V O2max and had a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy to examine capillarization and metabolic enzymes [citrate synthase, -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (-HAD), and glycogen phosphorylase]. V O2max had a hierarchical pattern (YE LLE OH, P 0.05) for women (44 2 26 2 18 1 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg1{\textperiodcentered} min1) and men (53 3 34 1 22 1 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg1{\textperiodcentered}min1) and was greater (P 0.05) in LLE-P (38 1 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg1{\textperiodcentered}min1) than LLE-F (27 2 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg1{\textperiodcentered}min1). LLE men regardless of intensity and women had similar capillarization and aerobic enzyme activity (citrate synthase and -HAD) as YE, which were 20{\%}–90{\%} greater (P 0.05) than OH. In summary, these data show a substantial V O2max benefit with LLE that tracked similarly between the sexes, with further enhancement in performance-trained men. For skeletal muscle, 50 years of aerobic exercise fully preserved capillarization and aerobic enzymes, regardless of intensity. These data suggest that skeletal muscle metabolic fitness may be easier to maintain with lifelong aerobic exercise than more central aspects of the cardiovascular system. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Lifelong exercise (LLE) is a relatively new and evolving area of study with information especially limited in women and individuals with varying exercise intensity habits. These data show a substantial maximal oxygen consumption benefit with LLE that tracked similarly between the sexes. Our findings contribute to the very limited skeletal muscle biopsy data from LLE women (70 yr), and similar to men, revealed a preserved metabolic phenotype comparable to young exercisers.},

Methods: Extensive assessments included medical examinations, interviews, musculoskeletal structure, performance characteristics, cognitive function and gut microbiota composition. Results: I.K. suffers from iatrogenic hypogonadism, prostate cancer, hypothyroidism and a history of deep popliteal thrombosis. Notwithstanding, he cycles up to 5,000 km a year and participates in competitive sports. His musculoskeletal properties, athletic performance, cognitive function and gut microbiota are outstanding. Some traits even exceed those seen in middle-aged men. Conclusions: His long-term physically and intellectually active lifestyles combined with extensive social interactions have most likely contributed to his exercise capacity, despite his medical history.},

abstract = {The genus Aurelia is one of the major contributors to jellyfish blooms in coastal waters, possibly due in part to hydroclimatic and anthropogenic causes, as well as their highly adaptive reproductive traits. Despite the wide plasticity of cnidarian life cycles, especially those recognized in certain Hydroza species, the known modifications of Aurelia life history were mostly restricted to its polyp stage. In this study, we document the formation of polyps directly from the ectoderm of degenerating juvenile medusae, cell masses from medusa tissue fragments, and subumbrella of living medusae. This is the first evidence for backtransformation of sexually mature medusae into polyps in Aurelia sp.1. The resulting reconstruction of the schematic life cycle of Aurelia reveals the underestimated potential of life cycle reversal in scyphozoan medusae, with possible implications for biological and ecological studies.},

In a few cases ontogeny reversal is possible, but it does not occur typically after the onset of sexual reproduction. All stages of the medusa Turritopsis nutricula, from newly liberated to fully mature individuals, can transform back into colonial hydroids, either directly or through a resting period, thus escaping death and achieving potential immortality. This is the first metazoan known to revert to a colonial, juvenile morph after having achieved sexual maturity in a solitary stage. Selective excision experiments show that the transformation of medusae into polyps occurs only if differentiated cells of the exumbrellar epidermis and part of the gastrovascular system are present, revealing a transformation potential unparalleled in the animal kingdom.},

There has been much controversy, however, about the potential immortality of hydra, a solitary freshwater member of the phylum Cnidaria, one of the earliest diverging metazoan groups. Researchers have suggested that hydra is capable of escaping aging by constantly renewing the tissues of its body. But no data have been published to support this assertion. To test for the presence or absence of aging in hydra, mortality and reproductive rates for three hydra cohorts have been analyzed for a period of four years. The results provide no evidence for aging in hydra: mortality rates have remained extremely low and there are no apparent signs of decline in reproductive rates. Hydra may have indeed escaped senescence and may be potentially immortal.},

abstract = {Secular changes and intra-individual differences in body shape and size can confound cross-sectional studies of muscle ageing. Normalising muscle mass to height squared is often suggested as a solution for this. We hypothesised that normalisation of muscle volume to femur volumemay be a better way of determining the extent of muscle lost with ageing (sarcopenia). Thigh and femur muscle volumes were measured from serial magnetic resonance imaging sections in 20 recreationally active young men (mean age 22.4 years), 25 older men (72.3 years), 18 young women (22.1 years) and 28 older women (72.0 years). There were no age-related differences in femur volume. The relationship between thigh muscle volume and femur volume (R2=0.76; exponent of 1.12; P{\textless}0.01) was stronger than that with height (R2=0.49; exponent of 3.86; P{\textless}0.01) in young participants. For young subjects, the mean muscle/bone ratios were 16.0 and 14.6 for men and women, respectively. For older men and women, the mean ratios were 11.6 and 11.5, respectively. The Z score for the thigh muscle/bone volume ratio relative to young subjects was -2.2±0.7 for older men and -1.4±0.8 for older women. The extent of sarcopenia judged by the muscle/bone ratio was approximately twice that determined when normalising to height squared. These data suggest that the muscle/bone ratio captures the intra-individual loss of muscle mass during ageing, and that the age-related loss of muscle mass may be underestimated when normalised to height squared. The quadriceps seems relatively more affected by ageing than other thigh muscles. {\textcopyright} American Aging Association 2013.},

To investigate, 40 older (20 women; age 72 ± 4 years) and 31 younger adults (15 women, age 22 ± 3 years) completed measurements. The knee extensor maximal voluntary torque (MVC) was measured as well as voluntary activation, patella tendon moment arm length, muscle volume, and fascicle architecture to estimate in situ specific force. Fiber cross-sectional area (FCSA), fiber numbers, and connective tissue contents were also estimated from vastus lateralis biopsies. The MVC, quadriceps volume, and specific force were 39{\%}, 28{\%}, and 17{\%} lower, respectively, in old compared with young, but voluntary activation was not different. The difference in muscle size was due in almost equal proportions to lower type II FCSA and fewer fibers. Five years later (n = 23) the MVC, muscle volume and voluntary activation in old decreased an additional 12{\%}, 6{\%}, and 4{\%}, respectively, but there was no further change in specific force. In situ specific force declines relatively early in older age and reduced voluntary activation occurs later, but the overall weakness in sarcopenia is mainly related to loss of both type I and II fibers and type II fiber atrophy.},

abstract = {Denervation leads to significant muscle atrophy, but it is less clear whether 1) loss of capillaries, fibre size and oxidative capacity decline in parallel and 2) the time course of these changes differs between young and old animals. To investigate this, we denervated the left gastrocnemius muscle for 1, 2 or 4 weeks, while the right muscle served as an internal control, in rats that were 5 or 25 months old at the end of the experiment. In the fast part of the gastrocnemius muscle, almost all atrophy had occurred after two weeks (42{\%}) of denervation. Even after 4 weeks of denervation, there was no significant reduction in the oxidative capacity of the muscle. Significant capillary loss occurred only after 4 weeks of denervation (P {\textless} 0.001) that lagged behind and was less than proportional to the decrease in fibre size. Consequently, the capillary density was elevated (P {\textless} 0.001). The time course of these morphological changes was similar in the 5- and 25-month-old rats. Comparing these data with those previously published in the soleus muscle from the same animals show that the decrease in oxidative capacity and capillary rarefaction were more pronounced and occurred earlier than in the gastrocnemius muscle, respectively. The time course of capillary loss lagged behind the decrease in fibre size, and combined with the absence of denervation-induced changes in oxidative capacity this resulted in a muscle capillary supply in excess of that expected by the metabolism and fibre size at least during the first 4 weeks after denervation.},

While muscle mass, determined by DXA and MRI, did not correlate with performance in the older adults, power per body mass, determined from a countermovement jump, did correlate.

World records show accelerated declines after age 70 in swimming, long-distance running and sprint performance.

We interrogated a dataset including all track and field athletes of North Rhine from 2001 to 2014 to assess age-related changes in performance. 27,088 results of athletes between 11 and 89 years of age in 12 disciplines were analyzed by regression statistics. The analyses showed an accelerated decline beyond the age of 70 in sprint, middle- and long-distance running, while in throwing and jumping disciplines the performance continued a linear decline. Patterns of decline differed between men and women. The steepest declines were observed in javelin throw and 400 m (women), and in pole vault and 800 m (men). In conclusion, performance declines in aging depend more on the specific profile of requirements than previously assumed.},

abstract = {We examined the influence of lifelong aerobic exercise on skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity. Young exercisers [YE; n = 20, 10 women (W), 25 ± 1 yr], lifelong exercisers (LLE; n = 28, 7 W, 74 ± 2 yr), and old healthy nonexercisers (OH; n = 20, 10 W, 75 ± 1 yr) were studied. On average, LLE exercised 5 days/wk for 7 h/wk over the past 52 ± 1 yr. The LLE men were subdivided by exercise intensity [Performance (LLE-P), n = 14; Fitness (LLE-F), n = 7]. Upper and lower leg muscle size and adiposity [intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT)] were determined via MRI, and quadriceps isotonic and isometric function was assessed. For the quadriceps, aging decreased muscle size, isotonic and isometric strength, contraction velocity (men only), and power (P {\textless} 0.05). In women, LLE did not influence muscle size or function. In men, LLE attenuated the decline in muscle size and isometric strength by ∼50{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). LLE did not influence other aspects of muscle function, nor did training intensity influence muscle size or function. For the triceps surae, aging decreased muscle size only in the women, whereas LLE (both sexes) and training intensity (LLE men) did not influence muscle size. In both sexes, aging increased thigh and calf IMAT by ∼130{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas LLE attenuated the thigh increase by ∼50{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). In the LLE men, higher training intensity decreased thigh and calf IMAT by ∼30{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). In summary, aging and lifelong aerobic exercise influenced muscle size, function, and adipose tissue infiltration in a sex- and muscle-specific fashion. Higher training intensity throughout the life span provided greater protection against adipose tissue infiltration into muscle. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to examine skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity in women and men in their eighth decade of life that have engaged in lifelong aerobic exercise. The findings reveal sex and upper and lower leg muscle group-specific benefits related to skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity and that exercise intensity influences intermuscular adiposity. This emerging cohort will further our understanding of the health implications of maintaining exercise throughout the life span.},

However, it is unclear whether AZ use impairs exercise performance; previous literature regarding this topic is equivocal. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of AZ on time-trial (TT) performance during a 30-h exposure to hypobaric hypoxia equivalent to 3,500-m altitude. Ten men [sea-level peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak): 50.8 ± 6.5 mL kg-1 min-1; body fat {\%}: 20.6 ± 5.2{\%}] completed 2 30-h exposures at 3,500 m. In a crossover study design, subjects were given 500 mg/day of either AZ or a placebo. Exercise testing was completed 2 h and 24 h after ascent and consisted of 15-min steadystate treadmill walking at 40{\%}-45{\%} sea-level VO2peak, followed by a 2-mile self-paced treadmill TT. AMS was assessed after ∼12 h and 22 h at 3,500 m. The incidence of AMS decreased from 40{\%} with placebo to 0{\%} with AZ. Oxygen saturation was higher (P {\textless}0.05) in AZ versus placebo trials at the end of the TT after 2 h (85 ± 3{\%} vs. 79 ± 3{\%}) and 24 h (86 ± 3{\%} vs. 81 ± 4{\%}). There was no difference in time to complete 2 miles between AZ and PL after 2 h (20.7 ± 3.2 vs. 22.7 ± 5.0 min, P {\textgreater}0.05) or 24 h (21.5 ± 3.4 vs. 21.1 ± 2.9 min, P {\textgreater}0.05) of exposure to altitude.

After binding with ER$\beta$ or perhaps independently of estrogen receptors, isoflavones may augment vascular endothelial relaxation, contributing to improved limb blood flow. Purpose To determine if acute fermented soy extract supplementation influences 20-km time trial cycling performance and cardiac hemodynamics compared with a placebo. Methods Subjects included 25 cyclists and triathletes (31 ± 8 yr, V-O2peak: 55.1 ± 8.4 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1). Each subject completed a V-O2peak assessment, familiarization, and two 20-km time trials in randomized order after ingestion of a fermented soy extract supplement or placebo. The fermented soy extract consisted of 30 g powdered supplement in 16 fl. ounces of water. The placebo contained the same quantities of organic cocoa powder and water. Each trial consisted of 60 min of rest, 30 min at 55{\%} Wpeak, and a self-paced 20-km time trial. Results Soy supplementation elicited a faster time to 20-km completion (-0.22 ± 0.51 min; -13 s), lower average HR (-5 ± 7 bpm), and significantly greater power (7 ± 3 W) and speed (0.42 ± 0.16 km{\textperiodcentered}h-1) during the last 5 km of the time trial compared with placebo. Analysis of the results by relative fitness level ({\textless}57 vs ≥ 57 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1) indicated that those with a higher level of fitness reaped the largest performance improvement alongside a reduced HR (-5 ± 7 bpm). Conclusions Ingestion of a fermented soy extract supplement improved sprint-distance performance through improvements in both power and speed. For those with great aerobic fitness, soy supplementation may help to decrease cardiac demand alongside performance improvement.},

abstract = {Introduction The aim of this study was to present the load, intensity, and performance characteristics of a general classification (GC) contender during multiple grand tours (GTs). This study also investigated which factors influence climbing performance. Methods Power output (PO) data were collected from a GC contender from the Vuelta a Espa{\~{n}}a 2015, the Giro d'Italia 2017, the Giro d'Italia 2018, and the Tour de France 2018. Load (e.g., Training Stress Score and kJ spent) and intensity in five PO zones were quantified. One-way ANOVA was used to identify differences between the GTs. Furthermore, performance during the four GTs was quantified based on maximal mean PO (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) over different durations and by the relative PO (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) on the key mountains in the GTs. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify which factors influence relative PO on the key mountains. Results No significant differences were found between load and intensity characteristics between the four GTs, with the exception that during the Giro d'Italia 2018, a significantly lower absolute time was spent in PO zone 5 (P = 0.005) compared with the other three GTs. The average relative PO on the key mountains (n = 33) was 5.9 ± 0.6 W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 and was negatively influenced by the duration of the climb and the total elevation gain before the key mountain, whereas the gradient of the mountain had a positive effect on relative PO. Conclusions The physiological load imposed on a GC contender did not differ between multiple GTs. Climbing performance was influenced by short-term fatigue induced by previous altitude meters in the stage and the duration and gradient of the mountain.},

abstract = {Fascicle length of m. vastus lateralis in cyclists has been shown to correlate positively with peak sprint cycling power normalized for lean body mass. We investigated whether vasti morphology affects sprint cycling power via force-length and forcevelocity relationships. We simulated isokinetic sprint cycling at pedaling rates ranging from 40 to 150 rpm with a forward dynamic model of the human musculoskeletal system actuated by eight leg muscles. Input of the model was muscle stimulation over time, which was optimized to maximize the average power output over a pedal cycle. This was done for a reference model and for models in which the vasti had equal volume but different morphology. It was found that models with longer muscle fibers but a reduced physiological cross-sectional area of the vasti produced a higher sprint cycling power. This was partly explained by better alignment of the peak power-pedaling rate curve of the vasti with the corresponding curves of the other leg muscles. The highest sprint cycling power was achieved in a model in which the increase in muscle fiber length of the vasti was accompanied by a concomitant shift in optimum knee angle. It was concluded that muscle mechanics can partly explain the positive correlations between fascicle length of m. vastus lateralis and normalized peak sprint cycling power. It should be investigated whether muscle fiber length of the vasti and optimum knee angle are suitable training targets for athletes who want to concurrently improve their sprint and endurance cycling performance. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY We simulated isokinetic sprint cycling at pedaling rates ranging from 40 to 150 rpm with a forward dynamic model of the human musculoskeletal system actuated by eight leg muscles. We selectively modified vasti morphology: we lengthened the muscle fibers and reduced the physiological cross-sectional area. The modified model was able to produce a higher sprint cycling power.},

abstract = {This report describes a new method allowing to measure the three-dimensional forces applied on right and left pedals during cycling. This method is based on a cycle ergometer mounted on a force platform. By recording the forces applied on the force platform and applying the fundamental mechanical equations, it was possible to calculate the instantaneous three-dimensional forces applied on pedals. It was validated by static and dynamic tests. The accuracy of the present system was -7.61 N, -3.37 N and -2.81 N, respectively, for the vertical, the horizontal and the lateral direction when applying a mono-directional force and -4.52 N when applying combined forces. In pedaling condition, the orientation and magnitude of the pedal forces were comparable to the literature. Moreover, this method did not modify the mechanical properties of the pedals and offered the possibility for pedal force measurement with materials often accessible in laboratories. Measurements obtained showed that this method has an interesting potential for biomechanical analyses in cycling. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The extrapolated center of mass (XCoM), a valuable tool to assess balance stability, involves defining the whole body center of mass (CoMWB). However, accurate three-dimensional estimation of the CoMWB is time consuming, a severe limitation in certain applications. In this study, twenty-four subjects (young and elderly, male and female) performed three different balance tasks: quiet standing, gait and balance recovery. Three different models, based on a segmental method, were used to estimate the three-dimensional CoMWB absolute position during these movements: a reference model based on 38 markers, a simplified 13-marker model and a single marker (sacral) model. CoMWB and XCoM estimations from the proposed simplified model came closer to the reference model than estimations from the sacral marker model. It remained accurate for dynamic tasks, where the sacral marker model proved inappropriate. The simplified model proposed here yields accurate three-dimensional estimation of both the CoMWB and the XCoM with a limited number of markers. Importantly, using this model would reduce the experimental and post-processing times for future balance studies assessing dynamic stability in humans.},

Method: Eleven eumenorrheic female athletes (mean age: 21.18 ± 3.65 years, height: 170.2 ± 6.6 cm, VO2max: 49.25 ± 9.15 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1, and menstrual cycle: 29.8 ± 0.98 days) were tested for anthropometric variables, physiological responses (oxygen consumption [VO2], blood lactate [LA], heart rate [HR], and respiratory exchange ratio [RER]) at rest and while running. The RE was measured at speeds of 75{\%}, 85{\%}, and 95{\%} of the lactate threshold at 3.5 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 during the follicular (FP) and luteal phases (LP) of the menstrual cycle. The RE was evaluated as oxygen consumption (mL{\textperiodcentered}kg{\textperiodcentered}min−1 [O2C{\_}min], mL{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}km−1 [O2C{\_}km]) and caloric unit cost (kcal{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}km−1 [EC]) during both phases. Results: There were no significant differences in body composition or resting physiological measurements between the LP and FP (p {\textgreater} .05). Physiological responses measured during RE tests were similar in both phases (p {\textgreater} .05). The RE measured as O2C{\_}min, O2C{\_}km, and EC was significantly lower during the LP than during the FP (p {\textless} .05).

abstract = {Muscle contractile mechanics induced by the changing demands of human movement have the potential to influence our movement strategies. This study examined fascicle length changes of the triceps surae during jumping with added mass or increasing jump height to determine whether the chosen movement strategies were associated with relevant changes in muscle contractile properties. Sixteen participants jumped at sub-maximal and maximal intensities while total net work was matched via two distinct paradigms: (1) adding mass to the participant or (2) increasing jump height. Electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound analyses were performed to examine muscle activation, fascicle length and fascicle velocity changes of the triceps surae during jumping. Integrated EMG was significantly higher in the added mass paradigm with no difference in mean or maximal EMG, indicating that the muscle was activated for a significantly longer period of time but not activated to a greater intensity. Fascicle shortening velocity was slower with added mass compared than with increasing jump height; therefore, intrinsic force–velocity properties probably enabled increased force production. Improved fascicle contractile mechanics paired with a longer activation period probably produced a consistently larger fascicle force, enabling a greater impulse about the ankle joint. This may explain why previous research found that participants used an ankle-centred strategy for work production in the added mass paradigm and not in the jump height paradigm. The varied architecture of muscles within the lower limb may influence which muscles we choose to employ for work production under different task constraints.},

abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that when learning a new motor task, the nervous system modifies feedforward (ie. voluntary) motor commands and that such learning transfers to fast feedback (ie. reflex) responses evoked by mechanical perturbations. Here we show the inverse, that learning new feedback responses transfers to feedforward motor commands. Sixty human participants (34 females) used a robotic exoskeleton and either 1) received short duration mechanical perturbations (20 ms) that created pure elbow rotation or 2) generated self-initiated pure elbow rotations. They did so with the shoulder joint free to rotate (normal arm dynamics) or locked (altered arm dynamics) by the robotic manipulandum. With the shoulder unlocked, the perturbation evoked clear shoulder muscle activity in the long-latency stretch reflex epoch (50-100ms post-perturbation), as required for countering the imposed joint torques, but little muscle activity thereafter in the so-called voluntary response. After locking the shoulder joint, which alters the required joint torques to counter pure elbow rotation, we found a reliable reduction in the long-latency stretch reflex over many trials. This reduction transferred to feedforward control as we observed 1) a reduction in shoulder muscle activity during self-initiated pure elbow rotation trials and 2) kinematic errors (ie. aftereffects) in the direction predicted when failing to compensate for normal arm dynamics, even though participants never practiced self-initiated movements with the shoulder locked. Taken together, our work shows that transfer between feedforward and feedback control is bidirectional, furthering the notion that these processes share common neural circuits that underlie motor learning and transfer.},

abstract = {A ubiquitous characteristic of elderly and patients with gait disabilities is that they walk slower than healthy controls. Many clinicians assume these patients walk slower to improve their stability, just as healthy people slow down when walking across ice. However, walking slower also leads to greater variability, which is often assumed to imply deteriorated stability. If this were true, then slowing down would be completely antithetical to the goal of maintaining stability. This study sought to resolve this paradox by directly quantifying the sensitivity of the locomotor system to local perturbations that are manifested as natural kinematic variability. Eleven young healthy subjects walked on a motorized treadmill at five different speeds. Three-dimensional movements of a single marker placed over the first thoracic vertebra were recorded during continuous walking. Mean stride-to-stride standard deviations and maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were computed for each time series to quantify the variability and local dynamic stability, respectively, of these movements. Quadratic regression analyses of the dependent measures vs. walking speed revealed highly significant U shaped trends for all three mean standard deviations, but highly significant linear trends, with significant or nearly significant quadratic terms, for five of the six finite-time Lyapunov exponents. Subjects exhibited consistently better local dynamic stability at slower speeds for these five measures. These results support the clinically based intuition that people who are at increased risk of falling walk slower to improve their stability, even at the cost of increased variability. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {It is widely accepted that humans and animals minimize energetic cost while walking. While such principles predict average behavior, they do not explain the variability observed in walking. For robust performance, walking movements must adapt at each step, not just on average. Here, we propose an analytical framework that reconciles issues of optimality, redundancy, and stochasticity. For human treadmill walking, we defined a goal function to formulate a precise mathematical definition of one possible control strategy: maintain constant speed at each stride. We recorded stride times and stride lengths from healthy subjects walking at five speeds. The specified goal function yielded a decomposition of stride-to-stride variations into new gait variables explicitly related to achieving the hypothesized strategy. Subjects exhibited greatly decreased variability for goal-relevant gait fluctuations directly related to achieving this strategy, but far greater variability for goalirrelevant fluctuations. More importantly, humans immediately corrected goal-relevant deviations at each successive stride, while allowing goal-irrelevant deviations to persist across multiple strides. To demonstrate that this was not the only strategy people could have used to successfully accomplish the task, we created three surrogate data sets. Each tested a specific alternative hypothesis that subjects used a different strategy that made no reference to the hypothesized goal function. Humans did not adopt any of these viable alternative strategies. Finally, we developed a sequence of stochastic control models of stride-to-stride variability for walking, based on the Minimum Intervention Principle. We demonstrate that healthy humans are not precisely "optimal," but instead consistently slightly over-correct small deviations in walking speed at each stride. Our results reveal a new governing principle for regulating stride-to-stride fluctuations in human walking that acts independently of, but in parallel with, minimizing energetic cost. Thus, humans exploit task redundancies to achieve robust control while minimizing effort and allowing potentially beneficial motor variability. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dingwell et al.},

abstract = {Minimization of metabolic energy is considered a fundamental principle of human locomotion, as demonstrated by an alignment between the preferred walking speed (PWS) and the speed incurring the lowest metabolic cost of transport. We aimed to (i) simultaneously disrupt metabolic cost and an alternate acute task requirement, namely speed error regulation, and (ii) assess whether the PWS could be explained on the basis of either optimality criterion in this new performance and energetic landscape. Healthy adults (N = 21) walked on an instrumented treadmill under normal conditions and, while negotiating a continuous gait perturbation, imposed leg-length asymmetry. Oxygen consumption, motion capture data and ground reaction forces were continuously recorded for each condition at speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.8 m s−1, including the PWS. Both metabolic and speed regulation measures were disrupted by the perturbation (p {\textless} 0.05). Perturbed PWS selection did not exhibit energetic prioritization (although we find some indication of energy minimization after motor adaptation). Similarly, PWS selection did not support prioritization of speed error regulation, which was found to be independent of speed in both conditions. It appears that, during acute exposure to a mechanical gait perturbation of imposed leg-length asymmetry, humans minimize neither energetic cost nor speed regulation errors. Despite the abundance of evidence pointing to energy minimization during normal, steady-state gait, this may not extend acutely to perturbed gait. Understanding how the nervous system acutely controls gait perturbations requires further research that embraces multi-objective control paradigms.},
annote = {METHODS SUMMARY
Healthy adults (N=21) walked on an instrumented treadmill under normal conditions and, while negotiating a continuous gait perturbation, imposed leg-length asymmetry. Oxygen consumption, motion capture data and ground reaction forces were continuously recorded for each condition at speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.8 m s−1, including the PWS.

Participants
- 21 Healthy young adults (11F/10M)
- US 7-11

Experimental protocol
- 6 x 5-min trials under the 'normal' condition
- 6 x 5-min trials under the 'perturbed' condition
- 6 treadmill speeds ranged from 0.6-1.8 m/s at 0.3 m/s increments + PWS (footwear specific)
- Order of conditions alternated, order of trials randomized

Imposed leg-length assymetry (see Figure 1 of platform shoe)
- Used previously for 2018 JEB paper
- On average the extra height was equal to 10.5{\%} of leg length
- Mass of normal footwear was matched to the platform shoe using small lead weights (Total mass?)
- Foam 20mm wider than shoe width
- Platform shoe randomnly assigned to left or right leg

PWS determination
- Dingwell {\&} Marin, 2016
- PWS were determined by starting from a relatively slow speed, and slowly increasing the treadmill speed until the subject reported that the current speed was faster than preferred. The treadmill speed was then increased further and slowly decreased until the subject reported that the current speed was slower than preferred. This procedure was repeated three times and the average of the 3 ‘‘faster'' and 3 ‘‘slower'' than preferred speeds was taken as the subject's PWS.
- PWS retested after perturbed condition (N=14), not a focus 

Measures
- GRF measured using a Bertec instrumented split-belt treadmill (2 kHz)
- Stride length and rate determined using GRF and marker on heel of normal shoe captured using a Vicon 10-camera system (250 Hz)
- Rate of oxygen consumption measured using portable Cosmed K5

Processing
- Steady-state oxygen consumption taken from final minute (12 samples?)
- COT vO2/kg/m
- minimum COT determined by fitting 2nd-order polynomial and compared to minimum at PWS
- Linear interpolation applied to marker and GRF data two frames surrounding heel strike

Speed-error regulation (GEM analysis) (see Figure 2)
- v = L/T or L = vT
- constant-speed line is the Goal-Equivalent Manifold (GEM)
- fluctuations along the line are goal equivalent as the do NOT change walking speed, fluctuations away from the line (perpendicular) are goal relevant because they do
- during normal treadmill walking people generally have greater fluctuations along the line that are more persistent, whereas fluctuations away from the line tend to be smaller and rapidly corrected (2:1)

Stability analysis or persistence (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)
- eigenvector and values used to categorize strong or weak stability corrections
- magnitude of eigenvalues indicate strength of regulation
- positive eigenvalues represent correction toward GEM, negative represents over-correction past GEM
- Weak tangential or normal to GEM?
- Strongly stable? vs. weakly stable? Persistent or anti-persistent
- Supp material 1 weak angle close to 0 deg. from vector tangential to GEM

abstract = {Center of mass (COM) control has been proposed to serve economy- and stability-related locomotor task objectives. However, given the lack of evidence supporting direct sensing and/or regulation of the COM, it remains unclear whether COM mechanics are prioritized in the control scheme of walking. We posit that peripheral musculoskeletal structures, e.g. muscle, are more realistic control targets than the COM, given their abundance of sensorimotor receptors and ability to influence whole-body energetics. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether conservation of stance-phase joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics in a locomotor task where simultaneous conservation of COM and joint mechanics is not feasible: imposed leg-length asymmetry. Positive joint mechanical cost of transport (work per distance traveled; COTJNT) was maintained at values closer to normal walking than COM mechanical cost of transport (COTCOM; P{\textless}0.05, N=15). Furthermore, compared with our measures of COM mechanics (COTCOM, COM displacement), joint-level variables (COTJNT, integrated total support moment) also displayed stronger conservation (less change from normal walking) when the participants' self-selected gait was assessed against other possible gait solutions. We conclude that when walking humans are exposed to an asymmetric leg-length perturbation, control of joint mechanics is prioritized over COM mechanics. Our results suggest that mechanical and metabolic effort is likely regulated via control of peripheral structures and not directly at the level of the COM. Joint mechanics may provide a more accurate representation of the underlying locomotor control targets and may prove advantageous in informing predictive models of human walking.},

abstract = {Introduction This case study reports a range of physiological characteristics in a two-time Tour de France champion. Methods After body composition assessment (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), two submaximal cycling step tests were performed in ambient (20°C, 40{\%}) and hot and humid (30°C, 60{\%} [HH]) conditions from which measures of gross efficiency (GE), lactate-power landmarks, and heart rate responses were calculated. In addition, thermoregulatory and sweat responses were collected throughout. V-O 2peak and peak power output (PPO) were also identified after a separate ramp test to exhaustion. Results V-O 2peak and PPO were 5.91 L{\textperiodcentered}min -1 (84 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg -1 {\textperiodcentered}min -1) and 525 W, respectively, whereas mean GE values were 23.0{\%} and 23.6{\%} for ambient and HH conditions, respectively. In addition to superior GE, power output at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L -1 lactate was higher in HH versus ambient conditions (429.6 vs 419.0 W) supporting anecdotal reports from the participant of good performance in the heat. Peak core and skin temperature, sweat rate, and electrolyte content were higher in HH conditions. Body fat percentage was 9.5{\%}, whereas total fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral content were 6.7, 61.5, and 2.8 kg, respectively. Conclusion The aerobic physiology and PPO values indentified are among the highest reported for professional road cyclists. Notably, the participant displayed both a high V-O 2peak and GE, which is uncommon among elite cyclists and may be a contributing factor to their success in elite cycling. In addition, performance in HH conditions was strong, suggesting effective thermoregulatory physiology. In summary, this is the first study to report physiological characteristics of a multiple Tour de France champion in close to peak condition and suggests what may be the prerequisite physiological and thermoregulatory capacities for success at this level.},

abstract = {Fatigue is defined as a failure to maintain the required or expected force. The force of a voluntary contraction is graded according to both the tension generated in each muscle fibre and the number of fibres recruited. The same is true of fatigue. Percutaneous electrical stimulation of a muscle via its motor nerve allows the contractile function to be measured independently of volition. Studies have been made of the forces generated isometrically at different stimulation frequencies (frequency: force curve), and of fati- guability (tendency to lose force in a given time at specified stimulation frequencies), in the quadriceps and adductor pollicis muscles. Electrical stimulation recordings of the prog- rammed stimulation myograms distinguish forms of muscle fatigue. Low frequency fatigue which implies impaired excitation-contraction coupling is long-lasting, whereas high frequency fatigue which represents impaired muscle membrane excitation recovers rapidly. Electromyographic (EMG) indicators of fatigue are well recognized but their use is limited because they cannot alone indicate whether alterations in excitation-contraction coupling underlie fatigue. Alterations in the power spectrum of the EMG precede (force) fatigue in sustained maximum voluntary contractions. Fatigue may ultimately be due to a failure of the rate of energy supply to meet demand, but the precise expression of this defect may vary, such that failure of excitation or of activation may predominate over failure of the energy supply.

abstract = {Trained endurance runners appear to fine-tune running mechanics to minimise metabolic cost. Referred to as self-optimisation, the support for this concept has primarily been collated from only a few gait (e.g. stride frequency, length) and physiological (e.g., oxygen consumption, heart rate) characteristics. To extend our understanding, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of manipulating ground contact time on the metabolic cost of running in trained endurance runners. Additionally, the relationships between metabolic cost and, leg stiffness and perceived effort were examined. Ten participants completed 5x6-minute treadmill running conditions. Self-selected ground contact time and step frequency were determined during habitual running, which was followed by ground contact times being increased or decreased in four subsequent conditions whilst maintaining step frequency (2.67±0.15Hz). The same self-selected running velocity was used across all conditions for each participant (12.7±1.6 km∙h{\^{}}(-1)). Oxygen consumption was used to compute the metabolic cost of running and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded for each run. Ground contact time and step frequency were used to estimate leg stiffness. Identifiable minimums and a curvilinear relationship between ground contact time and metabolic cost was found for all runners (r2 = 0.84). A similar relationship was observed between leg stiffness and metabolic cost (r2=0.83). Most (90{\%}) runners self-selected a ground contact time and leg stiffness that produced metabolic costs within 5{\%} of their mathematical optimal. The majority (n=6) of self-selected ground contact times were shorter than mathematical optimals, whilst the majority (n=7) of self-selected leg stiffness' were higher than mathematical optimals. Metabolic cost and RPE were moderately associated (rs=0.358 p=0.011), but controlling for condition (habitual/manipulated) weakened this relationship (rs=0.302, p=0.035). Both ground contact time and leg stiffness appear to be self-optimised characteristics, as trained runners were operating at or close to their mathematical optimal. The majority of runners favoured a self-selected gait that may rely on elastic energy storage and release due to shorter ground contact times and higher leg stiffness's than optimal. Using RPE as a surrogate measure of metabolic cost during manipulated running gait is not recommended.},

abstract = {Filamentous Desulfobulbaceae bacteria were recently discovered as long-range transporters of electrons from sulfide to oxygen in marine sediments. The long-range electron transfer through these cable bacteria has created considerable interests, but it has also raised many questions, such as what structural basis will be required to enable micrometer-sized cells to build into centimeter-long continuous filaments? Here we dissected cable bacteria cells in vitro by atomic force microscopy and further explored the interior, which is normally hidden behind the outer membrane. Using nanoscale topographical and mechanical maps, different types of bacterial cell-cell junctions and strings along the cable length were identified. More important, these strings were found to be continuous along the bacterial cells passing through the cell-cell junctions. This indicates that the strings serve an important function in maintaining integrity of individual cable bacteria cells as a united filament. Furthermore, ridges in the outer membrane are found to envelop the individual strings at cell-cell junctions, and they are proposed to strengthen the junctions. Finally, we propose a model for the division and growth of the cable bacteria, which illustrate the possible structural requirements for the formation of centimeter-length filaments in the recently discovered cable bacteria.},

abstract = {Given two rewarding stimuli, animals tend to choose the more rewarding (or less effortful) option. However, they also move faster toward that stimulus [1–5]. This suggests that reward and effort not only affect decision-making, they also influence motor control [6, 7]. How does the brain compute the effort requirements of a task? Here, we considered data acquired during walking, reaching, flying, or isometric force production. In analyzing the decision-making and motor-control behaviors of various animals, we considered the possibility that the brain may estimate effort objectively, via the metabolic energy consumed to produce the action. We measured the energetic cost of reaching and found that, like walking, it was convex in time, with a global minimum, implying that there existed a movement speed that minimized effort. However, reward made it worthwhile to be energetically inefficient. Using a framework in which utility of an action depended on reward and energetic cost, both discounted in time, we found that it was possible to account for a body of data in which animals were free to choose how to move (reach slow or fast), as well as what to do (walk or fly, produce force F1 or F2). We suggest that some forms of decision-making and motor control may share a common utility in which the brain represents the effort associated with performing an action objectively via its metabolic energy cost and then, like reward, temporally discounts it as a function of movement duration.},

abstract = {This pilot study investigated whether a 10-week running program (10wkRP), which reduced the oxygen cost of running, affected resultant ground reaction force (GRF), leg axis alignment, joint moment characteristics, and gear ratios. Ten novice, female runners completed a 10wkRP. Running kinematics and kinetics, in addition to oxygen consumption ( V ˙ O 2 ) during steady-state running, were recorded pre- and post-10wkRP. V ˙ O 2 decreased (8{\%}) from pre-10wkRP to post-10wkRP. There was a better alignment of the resultant GRF and leg axis at peak propulsion post-10wkRP compared with pre-10wkRP (10.8 ± 4.9 vs 1.6 ± 1.2°), as the resultant GRF vector was applied 7 ± 0.6° (P = 0.008) more horizontally. There were shorter external ankle moment arms (24{\%}) and smaller knee extensor moments (23{\%}) at peak braking post-10wkRP. The change in V ˙ O 2 was associated with the change in alignment of the resultant GRF and leg axis (rs  = 0.88, P = 0.003). As runners became more economical, they exhibited a more aligned resultant GRF vector and leg axis at peak propulsion. This appears to be a self-optimization strategy that may improve performance. Additionally, changes to external ankle moment arms indicated beneficial low gear ratios were achieved at the time of peak braking force.},

abstract = {During running, the lower limbs musculo-tendinous system behaves like a spring-mass system. From an external mechanical point of view, the complexity of the running motion (that involves force production, motion and coordination at the hip, knee and ankle levels, to ensure propulsion and balance) can be well described by the behavior of a single, linear spring-mass system. The vertical ground reaction force over time during contact on the ground shows a sine-wave behavior, and the vertical downward displacement of the center of mass a concomitant u-shape behavior. In this model the relationship between compressive force in the spring and change of length is linear and the slope of this relationship is equivalent to the stiffness of the spring. Since this model was first developed in the late 1980s, it has been used as a practical approach to study human and animal running mechanics, mainly with ground reaction forces measurements (force plates or instrumented treadmill) and high-speed motion analysis. This chapter presents the theoretical bases of this model, and a simple field method to compute the main spring-mass variables during running. This method is based on a sine-wave modeling of the ground reaction force trace and requires only five simple input variables: running velocity, the body mass of the runner, their lower limb length and contact and aerial times. In this chapter, we also detail how to measure these input variables, and examples of use of the sine-wave method in research and training practice.},

abstract = {Objective-To validate an equine inertial measurement unit (IMU) system rigidly attached to a hoof against a 3-D optical kinematics system in horses during walking and trotting. Animals-5 clinically normal horses. Procedures-5 swing phases of the hooves of the right forelimb and hind limb were collected via both 3-D optical and IMU systems from 5 horses during walking and trotting. Linear and angular positions, velocities, and accelerations were compared between the 2 systems. Results-Of the 55 variables compared between the 2 systems, 25 had high correlations (r {\textgreater} 0.8) and 18 had moderate correlations (r {\textgreater} 0.5). Root mean squared errors were lowest in the sagittal plane and orientation (1.1 to 4.4 cm over a range of 1.5 to 1.9 m in the cranialcaudal direction and 2.5° to 3.5° over a range of 88° to 110° rotating around the mediallateral axis). There were more differences between the 2 systems during small changes in motion, such as in the medial-lateral and proximal-distal directions and in the angular measures around the cranial-caudal and proximal-distal axes. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The equine IMU system may be appropriate for rigid attachment to a hoof of a horse and use in examination of linear and angular motion in the sagittal plane of the hoof during the swing phase while walking and trotting. Although promising in many respects, the IMU system cannot currently be considered clinically useful for lameness evaluation because of limitations in accuracy, attachment method, and lack of stance phase evaluation.},

abstract = {Background: The popular protocol used to study running motion suffers from problems that lead to a limited ability to generalize the obtained results. Inertial measurement units (IMU) appear to be promising in increasing ecological validity of the collected data. However, quantifying running kinematics utilizing IMU signals is complex and potentially affected by several well-established and less well-known errors. Research question: The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of kinematic variables obtained from a single, shoe-mounted IMU using an opto-electronic motion analysis reference system. Methods: 51 recreational runners were analyzed, performing a single continuous run at three different speeds (10, 12, 15 km/h) on a treadmill. Descriptive statistics (Bland {\&} Altman analysis, box plots, scatter plots) were employed to analyze the agreement between the two instruments. Results: The findings of this study revealed considerable systematic and large random disagreement, which, in turn, is characterized by substantial inter-individual differences in the error distribution. These discrepancies may partly be explained by differences in foot strike behavior, resulting in varying degrees of vibration impact acting on the IMU. Significance: Advances in IMU technology, as well as exploring new application approaches and signal processing strategies, might enhance the usability of IMUs in analyzing running kinematics.},

Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) has been suggested as suitable method for analyzing one-dimensional data such as kinematic, kinetic or muscle intensity time series. Research question: The purpose of this study was to determine differences in treadmill running mechanics between novel running shoes using SPM. Methods: Joint kinematics, muscle activity and ground reaction force were assessed in 19 rearfoot runners in their own shoes and in two test shoes during treadmill running (test shoe 1: 13 distinct rubber elements in the outer sole, springboard within EVA midsole with posterior elements shifted anteriorly by approximately 1.5 cm; test shoe 2: 17 distinct EVA elements with conventional heel geometry). Joint kinematics were measured using an inertial sensor system, and ground reaction force was measured using an instrumented treadmill. Results: SPM analysis with repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant reductions in the ankle angle and in tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, vastus medialis and lateralis muscle activity during weight acceptance and in peroneus longus muscle activity during early and late swing and in semitendinosus muscle activity during late swing for the test shoes. Significant differences in muscle activity were observed in the interval of the main activity of the respective muscle. SPM on individual data revealed statistically significant and relevant within-subject differences between conditions in kinematic, muscle activity and ground reaction force patterns. Significance: Inertial sensor systems and SPM may provide an efficient way of detecting changes in joint mechanics between running shoes within runners. Detecting within-subject differences in running mechanics between conditions not only requires statistical criteria but also criteria on the relevance of the magnitude of differences.},

abstract = {Background: Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor-based techniques are becoming more popular in horses as a tool for objective locomotor assessment. Objectives: To describe, evaluate and validate a method of stride detection and quantification at walk and trot using distal limb mounted IMU sensors. Study design: Prospective validation study comparing IMU sensors and motion capture with force plate data. Methods: A total of seven Warmblood horses equipped with metacarpal/metatarsal IMU sensors and reflective markers for motion capture were hand walked and trotted over a force plate. Using four custom built algorithms hoof-on/hoof-off timing over the force plate were calculated for each trial from the IMU data. Accuracy of the computed parameters was calculated as the mean difference in milliseconds between the IMU or motion capture generated data and the data from the force plate, precision as the s.d. of these differences and percentage of error with accuracy of the calculated parameter as a percentage of the force plate stance duration. Results: Accuracy, precision and percentage of error of the best performing IMU algorithm for stance duration at walk were 28.5, 31.6 ms and 3.7{\%} for the forelimbs and −5.5, 20.1 ms and −0.8{\%} for the hindlimbs, respectively. At trot the best performing algorithm achieved accuracy, precision and percentage of error of −27.6/8.8 ms/−8.4{\%} for the forelimbs and 6.3/33.5 ms/9.1{\%} for the hindlimbs. Main limitations: The described algorithms have not been assessed on different surfaces. Conclusions: Inertial measurement unit technology can be used to determine temporal kinematic stride variables at walk and trot justifying its use in gait and performance analysis. However, precision of the method may not be sufficient to detect all possible lameness-related changes. These data seem promising enough to warrant further research to evaluate whether this approach will be useful for appraising the majority of clinically relevant gait changes encountered in practice.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the orderly recruitment of motor units by size provides a functional advantage for the performance of movements compared with a random recruitment order. On the other hand, the excitability of a motor neuron depends on its size and this is intrinsically linked to its innervation number. A range of innervation numbers among motor neurons corresponds to a range of sizes and thus to a range of excitabilities ordered by size. Therefore, if the excitation drive is similar among motor neurons, the recruitment by size is inevitably due to the intrinsic properties of motor neurons and may not have arisen to meet functional demands. In this view, we tested the assumption that orderly recruitment is necessarily beneficial by determining if this type of recruitment produces optimal motor output. Using evolutionary algorithms and without any a priori assumptions, the parameters of neuromuscular models were optimized with respect to several criteria for motor performance. Interestingly, the optimized model parameters matched well known neuromuscular properties, but none of the optimization criteria determined a consistent recruitment order by size unless this was imposed by an association between motor neuron size and excitability. Further, when the association between size and excitability was imposed, the resultant model of recruitment did not improve the motor performance with respect to the absence of orderly recruitment. A consistent observation was that optimal solutions for a variety of criteria of motor performance always required a broad range of innervation numbers in the population of motor neurons, skewed towards the small values. These results indicate that orderly recruitment of motor units in itself does not provide substantial functional advantages for motor control. Rather, the reason for its near-universal presence in human movements is that motor functions are optimized by a broad range of innervation numbers. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Physiological Society.},

The aim of this study was to validate a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) for purpose of estimating countermovement jump height using the following methods: numerical double integration (NDI), takeoff velocity (TOV) and flight-time (FT). Methods: Fifteen students each performed three jumps in two different sessions, four weeks apart. Jump-heights calculated from motion capture and force plate were used as gold standard for global IMU position and center of mass (CoM) displacement, respectively. Results: The NDI method showed higher estimates for global position (1.39 cm, p = 0.025), and for CoM displacement (4.20 cm, p {\textless} 0.001). Narrow limits of agreements (LoA) were found ({\textless}4.8 cm). Further, a low tolerance level of determining equivalence (delta) between the two sessions regarding both global and CoM displacement (±2.80 and ± 2.90 cm) suggesting reasonable test-retest reliability. Similar bias was found for TOV and FT (p {\textless} 0.015) and wide LoAs were found for global position and for CoM displacement (TOV: ±7.05 and ± 9.36 cm, AT: ±9.27 and ± 8.49 cm). Further, high delta between the two sessions (TOV: ±3.50 cm, FT ±4.00 cm) showed poor test-retest reliability. Conclusion: Estimation of countermovement jump height using an IMU leads to the most accurate measurements applying the NDI-method. Countermovement jump estimated with an IMU can reliably evaluate functional performance in the lower extremities in young or in sports active patients after surgery or after rehabilitation. Countermovement jump with an IMU allows performing the test without a force plate and thus serves as an objective outcome measure in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Energy expenditure (EE) during walking includes energy costs to move and support the body and for respiration and circulation. We measured EE during walking under three different oxygen concentrations. Eleven healthy, young, male lowlanders walked on a treadmill at seven gait speeds (0.67-1.83 m s-1) on a level gradient under normobaric normoxia (room air, 21{\%} O2), moderate hypoxia (15{\%} O2), and severe hypoxia (11{\%} O2). By comparing the hypoxia-induced elevation in heart rate (HR [bpm]), ventilation (VE [L min-1]) with the change in energy expenditure (EE [W]) at each speed, we were able to determine circulatory and respiratory costs. In a multivariate model combining HR and VE, respiratory costs were 0.44 ± 0.15 W per each L min-1 increase in VE, and circulatory costs were 0.24 ± 0.05 W per each bpm increase in HR (model adjusted r2 = 0.97, p {\textless} 0.001). These VE costs were substantially lower than previous studies that ignored the contribution of HR to cardiopulmonary work. Estimated HR costs were consistent with, although somewhat higher than, measures derived from catheterization studies. Cardiopulmonary costs accounted for 23{\%} of resting EE, but less than 5{\%} of net walking costs (i.e., with resting EE subtracted).},

abstract = {Energy expenditure (EE) during treadmill walking under normal conditions (normobaric normoxia, 21{\%} O2) and moderate hypoxia (13{\%} O2) was measured. Ten healthy young men and ten healthy young women walked on a level (0°) gradient a range of speeds (0.67–1.67 m s−1). During walking, there were no significant differences in reductions in arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the sexes. The hypoxia-induced increase in EE, heart rate (HR [bpm]) and ventilation (V ̇ E [L min−1]) were calculated. Using a multivariate model that combined EE, V ̇ E, and HR to predict $\Delta$SpO2 (hypoxia-induced reduction), a very strong fit model both for men (r2 = 0.900, P {\textless} 0.001) and for women was obtained (r2 = 0.957, P {\textless} 0.001). The contributions of EE, VE, and HR to $\Delta$SpO2 were markedly different between men and women. V ̇ E and EE had a stronger effect on $\Delta$SpO2 in women (V ̇ E: 4.1{\%} in women vs. 1.7{\%} in men; EE: 28.1{\%} in women vs. 15.8{\%} in men), while HR had a greater effect in men (82.5{\%} in men and 67.9{\%} in women). These findings suggested that high-altitude adaptation in response to hypoxemia has different underlying mechanisms between men and women. These results can help to explain how to adapt high-altitude for men and women, respectively.},

Experiment 1 examined walking and running on a treadmill while speed was varied. The transition occurred at the equal-energy separatrix between gaits, with predicted shifts in stride length and frequency, a qualitative reorganization in the relative phasing of segments within a leg, a sudden jump in relative phase, enhanced fluctuations in relative phase, and hysteresis. Experiment 2 dissociated speed, frequency, and stride length to show that the transition occurred at a constant speed near the energy separatrix. Results are consistent with a dynamic theory of locomotion in which preferred gaits are characterized by stable phase relationships and minimum energy expenditure, and gait transitions by a loss of stability and the reduction of energetic costs. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Psychological Association.},

Incorrect bicycle configuration may predispose cyclist to injury but the evidence of an effect of saddle setback on knee pain remains inconclusive.

Ten cyclists were assessed under three saddle setback conditions (range of changes in saddle position {\~{}}6 cm) while pedalling at a steady power output of 200 W and cadence of 90 rpm. A cycling musculoskeletal model was developed and knee joint forces were estimated using an inverse dynamics method associated with a static optimisation procedure. Our results indicate that moving the saddle forwards was not associated with an increase of patellofemoral joint forces. On the contrary, the tibiofemoral mean and peak compression force were 14 and 15{\%} higher in the Backward than in the Forward condition, respectively. The peak compression force was related to neither pedal force nor quadriceps muscle force but coincided with the eccentric contraction of knee flexor muscles. These findings should benefit bike fitting practitioners and coaches in the design of specific training/rehabilitation protocols.},

Furthermore, the standard training and testing scenarios for these tasks are shown to be very limited and prone to over-fitting, thus giving rise to only trajectory-centric policies. Training with a diverse initial state distribution induces more global policies with better generalization. This allows for interactive control scenarios where the system recovers from large on-line perturbations; as shown in the supplementary video.},

abstract = {A surprising feature of animal locomotion is that organisms typically produce substantial forces in directions other than what is necessary to move the animal through its environment, such as perpendicular to, or counter to, the direction of travel. The effect of these forces has been difficult to observe because they are often mutually opposing and therefore cancel out. Indeed, it is likely that these forces do not contribute directly to movement but may serve an equally important role: to simplify and enhance the control of locomotion. To test this hypothesis, we examined a well-suited model system, the glass knifefish Eigenmannia virescens, which produces mutually opposing forces during a hovering behavior that is analogous to a hummingbird feeding from a moving flower. Our results and analyses, which include kinematic data from the fish, a mathematical model of its swimming dynamics, and experiments with a biomimetic robot, demonstrate that the production and differential control of mutually opposing forces is a strategy that generates passive stabilization while simultaneously enhancing maneuverability. Mutually opposing forces during locomotion are widespread across animal taxa, and these results indicate that such forces can eliminate the tradeoff between stability and maneuverability, thereby simplifying neural control.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding how stability and/or maneuverability affects motor control strategies can provide insight on moving about safely in an unpredictable world. Stability in human movement has been well-studied while maneuverability has not. Further, a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during movement seems apparent, yet has not been quantified. We proposed that greater maneuverability, the ability to rapidly and purposefully change movement direction and speed, is beneficial in uncertain environments. We also hypothesized that gaining maneuverability comes at the expense of stability and perhaps also corresponds with decreased muscle coactivation. Materials and Methods: We used a goal-directed forward lean movement task that integrated both stability and maneuverability. Subjects (n = 11) used their center of pressure to control a cursor on a computer monitor to reach a target. We added task uncertainty by shifting the target anterior-posterior position mid-movement. We used a balance board with a narrow beam that reduced the base of support in the medio-lateral direction and defined stability as the probability that subjects could keep the balance board level during the task. Results: During the uncertainty condition, subjects were able to change direction of their anterior-posterior center of pressure more rapidly, indicating that subjects were more maneuverable. Furthermore, medio-lateral center of pressure excursions also approached the edges of the beam and reduced stability margins, implying that subjects were less stable (i.e. less able to keep the board level). On the narrow beam board, subjects increased muscle coactivation of lateral muscle pairs and had greater muscle activity in the left leg. However, there were no statistically significant differences in muscle activity amplitudes or coactivation with uncertainty. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during a goal-directed whole-body movement. Tasks with added uncertainty could help individuals learn to be more maneuverable yet sufficiently stable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Huang, Ahmed.},

abstract = {Computer simulations of pedaling have shown that a wide range of pedaling tasks can be performed if each limb has the capability of executing six biomechanical functions, which are arranged into three pairs of alternating antagonistic functions. An Ext/Flex pair accelerates the limb into extension or flexion, a Plant/Dorsi pair accelerates the foot into plantarflexion or dorsiflexion, and an Ant/Post pair accelerates the foot anteriorly or posteriorly relative to the pelvis. Because each biomechanical function (i.e., Ext, Flex, Plant, Dorsi, Ant, or Post) contributes to crank propulsion during a specific region in the cycle, phasing of a muscle is hypothesized to be a consequence of its ability to contribute to one or more of the biomechanical functions. Analysis of electromyogram (EMG) patterns has shown that this biomechanical framework assists in the interpretation of muscle activity in healthy and hemiparetic subjects during forward pedaling. Simulations show that backward pedaling can be produced with a phase shift of 180°in the Ant/Post pair. No phase shifts in the Ext/Flex and Plant/Dorsi pairs are then necessary. To further test whether this simple yet biomechanically viable strategy may be used by the nervous system, EMGs from 7 muscles in 16 subjects were measured during backward as well as forward pedaling. As predicted, phasing in vastus medialis (VM), tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and soleus (SL) were unaffected by pedaling direction, with VM and SL contributing to Ext, MG to Plant, and TA to Dorsi. In contrast, phasing in biceps femoris (BF) and semimembranosus (SM) were affected by pedaling direction, as predicted, compatible with their contribution to the directionally sensitive Post function. Phasing of rectus femoris (RF) was also affected by pedaling direction; however, its ability to contribute to the directionally sensitive Ant function may only be expressed in forward pedaling. RF also contributed significantly to the directionally insensitive Ext function in both forward and backward pedaling. Other muscles also appear to have contributed to more than one function, which was especially evident in backward pedaling (i.e., BF, SM, MG, and TA to Flex). We conclude that the phasing of only the Ant and Post biomechanical functions are directionally sensitive. Further, we suggest that task-dependent modulation of the expression of the functions in the motor output provides this biomechanics-based neural control scheme with the capability to execute a variety of lower limb tasks, including walking.},

abstract = {Making a movement may be thought of as an economic decision in which one spends effort to acquire reward. Time discounts reward, which predicts that the magnitude of reward should affect movement vigor: we should move faster, spending greater effort, when there is greater reward at stake. Indeed, saccade peak velocities are greater and reaction-times shorter when a target is paired with reward. In this study, we focused on human reaching and asked whether movement kinematics were affected by expectation of reward. Participants made out-and-back reaching movements to one of four quadrants of a 14-cm circle. During various periods of the experiment only one of the four quadrants was paired with reward, and the transition from reward to nonreward status of a quadrant occurred randomly. Our experiment design minimized dependence of reward on accuracy, granting the subjects wide latitude in self-selecting their movement speed, amplitude, and variability. When a quadrant was paired with reward, reaching movements had a shorter reaction time, higher peak velocity, and greater amplitude. Despite this greater vigor, movements toward the rewarded quadrant suffered from less variability: both reaction times and reach kinematics were less variable when there was expectation of reward. Importantly, the effect of reward on vigor was specific to the movement component that preceded the time of reward (outward reach), not the movement component that followed it (return reach). Our results suggest that expectation of reward not only increases vigor of human reaching but also decreases its variability. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Movements may be thought of as an economic transaction where the vigor of the movement represents the effort that the brain is willing to expend to acquire a rewarding state. We show that in reaching, reward discounts the cost of effort, producing movements with shorter reaction time, higher velocity, greater amplitude, and reduced reaction-time variability. These results complement earlier observations in saccades, suggesting a common principle of economics across modalities of motor control.},

abstract = {The sensorimotor system is a product of evolution, development, learning and adaptation-which work on different time scales to improve behavioral performance. Consequently, many theories of motor function are based on 'optimal performance': they quantify task goals as cost functions, and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},

abstract = {Optimal choice of actions is a fundamental problem relevant to fields as diverse as neuroscience, psychology, economics, computer science, and control engineering. Despite this broad relevance the abstract setting is similar: we have an agent choosing actions over time, an uncertain dynamical system whose state is affected by those actions, and a performance criterion that the agent seeks to optimize. Solving problems of this kind remains hard, in part, because of overly generic formulations. Here, we propose a more structured formulation that greatly simplifies the construction of optimal control laws in both discrete and continuous domains. An exhaustive search over actions is avoided and the problem becomes linear. This yields algorithms that outperform Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning, and thereby solve traditional problems more efficiently. Our framework also enables computations that were not possible before: composing optimal control laws by mixing primitives, applying deterministic methods to stochastic systems, quantifying the benefits of error tolerance, and inferring goals from behavioral data via convex optimization. Development of a general class of easily solvable problems tends to accelerate progress - as linear systems theory has done, for example. Our framework may have similar impact in fields where optimal choice of actions is relevant.},

An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

abstract = {We explored how humans adjust the stance phase mechanical function of their major lower-limb joints (hip, knee, ankle) during maximum acceleration sprinting. Experimental data [motion capture and ground reaction force (GRF)] were recorded from eight participants as they performed overground sprinting trials. Six alternative starting locations were used to obtain a dataset that incorporated the majority of the acceleration phase. Experimental data were combined with an inverse-dynamics-based analysis to calculate lower-limb joint mechanical variables. As forward acceleration magnitude decreased, the vertical GRF impulse remained nearly unchanged whereas the net horizontal GRF impulse became smaller as a result of less propulsion and more braking. Mechanical function was adjusted at all three joints, although more dramatic changes were observed at the hip and ankle. The impulse from the ankle plantar-flexor moment was almost always larger than those from the hip and knee extensor moments. Forward acceleration magnitude was linearly related to the impulses from the hip extensor moment (R2=0.45) and the ankle plantar-flexor moment (R2=0.47). Forward acceleration magnitude was also linearly related to the net work done at all three joints, with the ankle displaying the strongest relationship (R2=0.64). The ankle produced the largest amount of positive work (1.55±0.17 J kg−1) of all the joints, and provided a significantly greater proportion of the summed amount of lower-limb positive work as running speed increased and forward acceleration magnitude decreased. We conclude that the hip and especially the ankle represent key sources of positive work during the stance phase of maximum acceleration sprinting.},

abstract = {Humans consistently coordinate their joints to perform a variety of tasks. Computational motor control theory explains these stereotypical behaviors using optimal control. Several cost functions have been used to explain specific movements, which suggests that the brain optimizes for a combination of costs and just varies their relative weights to perform different tasks. In the case of tunable human-machine interfaces, we hypothesize that the human-machine interface should be optimized according to the costs that the user cares about when making the movement. Here, we study how the relative weights of individual cost functions in a composite movement cost affect the optimal control signal produced by the user and the mapping between the user's control signals and the machine's output, using prosthesis control as a specific example. This framework was tested by building a hierarchical optimization model that independently optimized for the user control signal and the virtual dynamics of the device. Our results indicate the feasibility of the approach and show the potential for using such a model in prosthesis tuning. This method could be used to allow clinicians and users to tune their prosthesis based on costs they actually care about; and allow the platforms to be customized for the unique needs of every patient.},
annote = {Introduction
1. Optimal Control Theory
- The brain generates the best behavior it can, subject to the constraints imposed by the body and environment. The brain has evolved for the sole purpose of generating behavior advantageous to the organism. It is then reasonable to expect that, at least in natural and well-practiced tasks, the observed behavior will be close to optimal. This makes optimal control theory an appealing computational framework for studying the neural control of movement.

- Consider every action available at the current state, add its immediate cost to the optimal value of the resulting next state, and choose an action for which the sum is minimal.
- A mapping from states to actions is called control law or control policy.

2. Virtual Dynamics (VD)
- Designer decides how the input signal is mapped to the device output, which will dicate the ease of use. 
- Mouse and joystick 
- Different VDs favourable for different tasks

3. Current prosthetic control
- Proportional velocity control: maps the intensity of EMG to the speed of the prosthetic device
- A simple example of proportional myoelectric control is a system in which the electromyogram (EMG) from flexors and extensors of the user's forearm is measured, amplified, filtered, and smoothed by two active electrodes. This provides estimates of EMG amplitudes that can be sent to a hand controller. After applying thresholds to remove uncertainty at low contraction levels, the controller sets a voltage applied to the motor that is proportional to the contraction intensity

4. Tuning control to user and task
- Authors propose that blended VD of position and velocity of the device can achieve superior performance compared to just velocity.
- The relative weighting we assign to effort, time, and risk will affect the optimal mapping of IO

5. Clinical application
- Current tuning involves abstract parameters like gain and thresholds. Whereas, cost functions could allow more intuitive tuning of speed, energy expenditure, or accuracy.},

abstract = {Recently, a new enzymatic process for glycogen production was developed. In this process, short-chain amylose is used as a substrate for branching enzymes (BE, EC 2.4.1.18). The molecular weight of the enzymatically synthesized glycogen (ESG) depends on the size and concentration of the substrate. Structural and physicochemical properties of ESG were compared to those of natural source glycogen (NSG). The average chain length, interior chain length, and exterior chain length of ESG were 8.2-11.6, 2.0-3.3, and 4.2-7.6, respectively. These values were within the range of variation of NSG. The appearances of both ESG and NSG in solution were opalescent (milky white and slightly bluish). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy showed that ESG molecules formed spherical particles, and that there were no differences between ESG and NSG. Viscometric analyses also showed the spherical nature of both glycogens. When ESG and NSG were treated with pullulanase, a glucan-hydrolyzing enzyme known to degrade glycogen only on its surface portion, both glycogens were similarly degraded. These analyses revealed that ESG shares similar molecular shapes and surface properties with NSG. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigated the ergogenic effect in mice of administering highly branched cyclic dextrin (HBCD), a new type of glucose polymer, on the swimming endurance in an adjustable-current swimming pool. Male Std ddY mice were administered a HBCD, a glucose solution or water via a stomach sonde 10 min before, 10 min after or 30 min after beginning swimming exercise, and were then obliged to swim in the pool. The total swimming period until exhaustion, an index of the swimming endurance, was measured. An ergogenic effect of HBCD was observed at a dose of 500 mg/kg of body weight, whereas it had no effect at a dose of 166 mg/kg of body wt (p{\textless}0.05). The mice administered with the HBCD solution 10 min after starting the exercise were able to swim significantly longer (p{\textless}0.05) than the mice who had ingested water or the glucose solution. The rise in mean blood glucose level in the mice administered with HBCD, which was measured 20 min after starting swimming, was significantly lower (p{\textless}0.05) than that in the mice administered with glucose, although it was significantly higher (p{\textless}0.05) than that in the mice administered with water. The mean blood insulin rise in the mice given HBCD was significantly lower (p{\textless}0.05) than that in the mice given glucose. The mice administered with HBCD 30 min after starting the exercise swam significantly longer (p{\textless}0.05) than the mice who had ingested water, although the enhancement of swimming time was similar to that of the glucose-ingesting mice. The gastric emptying rate of the HBCD solution was significantly faster (p{\textless}0.05) than that of the glucose solution. However, this glucose polymer must have spent more time being absorbed because it has to be hydrolyzed before absorption, reflecting a lower and possibly longer-lasting blood glucose level. We conclude that the prolongation of swimming endurance in mice administered with HBCD depended on its rapid and longer-lasting ability for supplying glucose with a lower postprandial blood insulin response, leading to a delayed onset of fatigue. {\textcopyright} 1999, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {Snowboarding, along with Alpine skiing, is one of two most popular winter sports. While there are many studies on the mechanical conditions of movement in skiing, there is a lack of studies analyzing the forces affecting snowboarders. The difference in body orientation between snowboarding and skiing means that applying the same biomechanical rules to both sports is unjustified and a separate analysis is needed. The most difficult aspect of snowboarding is maintaining the correct body balance which is dependent on the directions and magnitudes of external forces and their torques. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the forces that affect a snowboarder on the slope and the effects of these forces on the maintenance of a stable body posture. The research method used in the work is based on the theoretical analysis of physical phenomena that occur during riding on the snowboard. The study describes the biomechanical conditions that allow the snowboarder to maintain an upright posture when standing and moving, as well as the forces that initiate movement and decelerate the snowboarder. The physical forces that appear when moving forward and along an arc are analyzed, as are the mechanical interdependences that enable effective snowboarding. Knowing the rules of forces action is the best method for understanding how a snowboarder move and keep the balance on a slope. The application of theoretical knowledge should improve not only the self-confidence and effectiveness of the snowboarders but also the safety of their riding.},

abstract = {A surface EMG signal represents the linear transformation of motor neuron discharge times by the compound action potentials of the innervated muscle fibers and is often used as a source of information about neural activation of muscle. However, retrieving the embedded neural code from a surface EMG signal is extremely challenging. Most studies use indirect approaches in which selected features of the signal are interpreted as indicating certain characteristics of the neural code. These indirect associations are constrained by limitations that have been detailed previously (Farina D, Merletti R, Enoka RM. J Appl Physiol 96: 1486-1495, 2004) and are generally difficult to overcome. In an update on these issues, the current review extends the discussion to EMG-based coherence methods for assessing neural connectivity. We focus first on EMG amplitude cancellation, which intrinsically limits the association between EMG amplitude and the intensity of the neural activation and then discuss the limitations of coherence methods (EEG-EMG, EMG-EMG) as a way to assess the strength of the transmission of synaptic inputs into trains of motor unit action potentials. The debated influence of rectification on EMG spectral analysis and coherence measures is also discussed. Alternatively, there have been a number of attempts to identify the neural information directly by decomposing surface EMG signals into the discharge times of motor unit action potentials. The application of this approach is extremely powerful, but validation remains a central issue.},

abstract = {Electromyography is often used to infer the pattern of production of force by skeletal muscles. The interpretation of muscle function from the electromyogram (EMG) is challenged by the fact that factors such as type of muscle fiber, muscle length, and muscle velocity can all influence the relationship between electrical and mechanical activity of a muscle. Simultaneous measurements of EMG, muscle force, and fascicle length in hindlimb muscles of wild turkeys allow us to probe the quantitative link between force and EMG. We examined two features of the force-EMG relationship. First, we measured the relaxation electromechanical delay (r-EMD) as the time from the end of the EMG signal to time of the end of force. This delay varied with locomotor speed in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG); it was longer at slow walking speeds than for running. This variation in r-EMD was not explained by differences in muscle length trajectory, as the magnitude of r-EMD was not correlated with the velocity of shortening of the muscle during relaxation. We speculate that the longer relaxation times at slow walking speeds compared with running may reflect the longer time course of relaxation in slower muscles fibers. We also examined the relationship between magnitude of force and EMG across a range of walking and running speeds. We analyzed the force-EMG relationship during the swing phase separately from the force-EMG relationship during stance phase. During stance, force amplitude (average force) was linearly related to mean EMG amplitude (average EMG). Forces during swing phase were lower than predicted from the stance phase force-EMG relationship. The different force-EMG relationships during the stance and swing phases may reflect the contribution of passive structures to the development of force, or a nonlinear force-EMG relationship at low levels of muscle activity. Together the results suggest that any inference of force from EMG must be done cautiously when a broad range of activities is considered. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

Among the many uses of the surface EMG in studying the neural control of movement, the review critically evaluates only some of the applications. The focus is on the relations between global features of the surface EMG and the underlying physiological processes. Because direct measurements of motor unit activation are not available and many factors can influence the signal, these relations are frequently misinterpreted. These errors are compounded by the counterintuitive effects that some system parameters can have on the EMG signal. The phenomenon of crosstalk is used as an example of these problems. The review describes the limitations of techniques used to infer the level of muscle activation, the type of motor unit recruited, the upper limit of motor unit recruitment, the average discharge rate, and the degree of synchronization between motor units. Although the global surface EMG is a useful measure of muscle activation and assessment, there are limits to the information that can be extracted from this signal.},

abstract = {At a macroscopic level, part of the ant colony life cycle is simple: a colony collects resources; these resources are converted into more ants, and these ants in turn collect more resources. Because more ants collect more resources, this is a multiplicative process, and the expected logarithm of the amount of resources determines how successful the colony will be in the long run. Over 60 years ago, Kelly showed, using information theoretic techniques, that the rate of growth of resources for such a situation is optimized by a strategy of betting in proportion to the probability of pay-off. Thus, in the case of ants, the fraction of the colony foraging at a given location should be proportional to the probability that resources will be found there, a result widely applied in the mathematics of gambling. This theoretical optimum leads to predictions as to which collective ant movement strategies might have evolved. Here, we show how colony-level optimal foraging behaviour can be achieved by mapping movement to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). This can be done by the ants following a (noisy) local measurement of the (logarithm of) resource probability gradient (possibly supplemented with momentum, i.e. a propensity to move in the same direction). This maps the problem of foraging (via the information theory of gambling, stochastic dynamics and techniques employed within Bayesian statistics to efficiently sample from probability distributions) to simple models of ant foraging behaviour. This identification has broad applicability, facilitates the application of information theory approaches to understand movement ecology and unifies insights from existing biomechanical, cognitive, random and optimality movement paradigms. At the cost of requiring ants to obtain (noisy) resource gradient information, we show that this model is both efficient and matches a number of characteristics of real ant exploration.},

abstract = {Aerobic capacity is negatively related to locomotion economy. The purpose of this paper is to determine what effect aerobic exercise training has on the relationship between net cycling oxygen uptake (inverse of economy) and aerobic capacity [peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak)], as well as what role mitochondrial coupled and uncoupled respiration may play in whole body aerobic capacity and cycling economy. Cycling net oxygen uptake and V O2peak were evaluated on 31 premenopausal women before exercise training (baseline) and after 8-16 wk of aerobic training. Muscle tissue was collected from 15 subjects at baseline and post-training. Mitochondrial respiration assays were performed using high-resolution respirometry. Pre-(r = 0.46, P {\textless} 0.01) and postexercise training (r = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.01) VO2 peak and cycling net oxygen uptake were related. In addition, uncoupled and coupled fat respiration were related both at baseline (r = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.01) and post-training (r = 0.89, P {\textless} 01). Post-training coupled (r = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.01) and uncoupled carbohydrate respiration (r = 0.52, P {\textless} 05) were related to cycle net oxygen uptake. In addition, correlations between VO2 peak and cycle net oxygen uptake persist both at baseline and after training, even after adjusting for submaximal cycle respiratory quotient (an index of fat oxidation). These results suggest that the negative relationship between locomotion economy and aerobic capacity is increased following exercise training. In addition, it is proposed that at least one of the primary factors influencing this relationship has its foundation within the mitochondria. Strong relationships between coupled and uncoupled respiration appear to be contributing factors for this relationship. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY The negative relationship between cycle economy and aerobic capacity is increased following exercise training. The strong relationship between coupled and uncoupled respiration, especially after training, appears to be contributing to this negative relationship between aerobic capacity and cycling economy, suggesting that mitochondrial economy is not increased following aerobic exercise training. These results are suggestive that training programs designed to improve locomotion economy should focus on changing biomechanics.},

abstract = {Since at least the 1920s, it has been reported that common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) differ from humans in being capable of exceptional feats of "super strength," both in the wild and in captive environments. A mix of anecdotal and more controlled studies provides some support for this view; however, a critical review of available data suggests that chimpanzee mass-specific muscular performance is a more modest 1.5 times greater than humans on average. Hypotheses for the muscular basis of this performance differential have included greater isometric force-generating capabilities, faster maximum shortening velocities, and/or a difference in myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform content in chimpanzee relative to human skeletal muscle. Here, we show that chimpanzee muscle is similar to human muscle in its single-fiber contractile properties, but exhibits a much higher fraction of MHC II isoforms. Unlike humans, chimpanzee muscle is composed of ∼67{\%} fast-twitch fibers (MHC IIa+IId). Computer simulations of species-specific whole-muscle models indicate that maximum dynamic force and power output is 1.35 times higher in a chimpanzee muscle than a human muscle of similar size. Thus, the superior mass-specific muscular performance of chimpanzees does not stem from differences in isometric force-generating capabilities or maximum shortening velocities - as has long been suggested - but rather is due in part to differences in MHC isoform content and fiber length. We propose that the hominin lineage experienced a decline in maximum dynamic force and power output during the past 7-8 million years in response to selection for repetitive, low-cost contractile behavior.},

abstract = {The dissociation between constant work rate of O2 uptake (VO2) and ramp VO2 at a given work rate might be mitigated during slowly increasing ramp protocols. This study characterized the VO2 dynamics in response to five different ramp protocols and constant-work-rate trials at the maximal metabolic steady state (MMSS) to characterize 1) the VO2 gain (G) in the moderate, heavy, and severe domains, 2) the mean response time ofVO2 (MRT), and 3) the work rates at lactate threshold (LT) and respiratory compensation point (RCP). Eleven young individuals performed five ramp tests (5, 10, 15, 25, and 30 W/min), four to five time-to-exhaustions for critical power estimation, and two to three constant-work-rate trials for confirmation of the work rate at MMSS. G was greatest during the slowest ramp and progressively decreased with increasing ramp slopes (from {\~{}}12 to {\~{}}8 ml•min-1•W-1, P {\textless} 0.05). The MRT was smallest during the slowest ramp slopes and progressively increased with faster ramp slopes (1 ± 1, 2 ± 1, 5 ± 3, and 10 ± 4, 15 ±6 W, P {\textless} 0.05). After "left shifting" the rampVO2 by the MRT, the work rate at LT was constant regardless of the ramp slope ({\~{}}150 W, P {\textgreater} 0.05). The work rate at MMSS was 215 ± 55 W and was similar and highly correlated with the work rate at RCP during the 5 W/min ramp (P {\textgreater} 0.05, r = 0.99; Lin's concordance coefficient = 0.99; bias=-3W; root mean square error = 6 W). Findings showed that the dynamics of VO2 (i.e., G) during ramp exercise explain the apparent dichotomy existing with constant-work-rate exercise. When these dynamics are appropriately "resolved", LT is constant regardless of the ramp slope of choice, and RCP and MMSS display minimal variations between each other. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY This study demonstrates that the dynamics of VO2 during ramp-incremental exercise are dependent on the characteristics of the increments in work rate, such that during slow-incrementing ramp protocols the magnitude of the dissociation between ramp VO2 and constant VO2 at a given work rate is reduced. Accurately accounting for these dynamics ensures correct characterizations of the VO2 kinetics at ramp onset and allows appropriate comparisons between ramp and constant-work-rate exercise-derived indexes of exercise intensity.},

abstract = {Active muscle performs various mechanical functions during locomotion: work output during shortening, work absorption when resisting (but not preventing) lengthening, and impulse (force–time integral) whenever there is active force. The energetic costs of these functions are important components in the energy budget during locomotion. We investigated how the pattern of stimulation and movement affects the mechanics and energetics of muscle fibre bundles isolated from wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The fibres were from muscles consisting of mainly fast-twitch, type 2 fibres. Fibre length was held constant (isometric) or a sinusoidal pattern of movement was imposed at a frequency similar to the stride frequency of running wild rabbits. Duty cycle (stimulation duration×movement frequency) and phase (timing of stimulation relative to movement) were varied. Work and impulse were measured as well as energy produced as heat. The sum of net work (work output−work input) and heat was taken as a measure of energetic cost. Maximum work output was produced with a long duty cycle and stimulation starting slightly before shortening, and was produced quite efficiently. However, efficiency was even higher with other stimulation patterns that produced less work. The highest impulse (considerably higher than isometric impulse) was produced when stimulation started while the muscle fibres were being lengthened. High impulse was produced very economically because of the low cost of producing force during lengthening. Thus, locomotion demanding high work, high impulse or economical work output or impulse requires a distinct pattern of stimulation and movement.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the effects of short-term, high-intensity interval-training (HIIT) heat acclimation (HA). Methods: Male cyclists/triathletes were assigned into either an HA (n = 13) or a comparison (COMP, n = 10) group. HA completed 3 cycling heat stress tests (HSTs) to exhaustion (60{\%} Wmax; HST1, pre-HA; HST2, post-HA; HST3, 7 d post-HA). HA consisted of 30-min bouts of HIIT cycling (6 min at 50{\%} Wmax, then 12 × 1-min 100{\%}-Wmax bouts with 1-min rests between bouts) on 5 consecutive days. COMP completed HST1 and HST2 only. HST and HA trials were conducted in 35°C/50{\%} relative humidity. Cycling capacity and physiological and perceptual data were recorded. Results: Cycling capacity was impaired after HIIT HA (77.2 [34.2] min vs 56.2 [24.4] min, P = .03) and did not return to baseline after 7 d of no HA (59.2 [37.4] min). Capacity in HST1 and HST2 was similar in COMP (43.5 [8.3] min vs 46.8 [15.7] min, P = .54). HIIT HA lowered resting rectal (37.0°C [0.3°C] vs 36.8°C [0.2°C], P = .05) and body temperature (36.0°C [0.3°C] vs 35.8°C [0.3°C], P = .03) in HST2 compared with HST1 and lowered mean skin temperature (35.4°C [0.5°C] vs 35.1°C [0.3°C], P = .02) and perceived strain on day 5 compared with day 1 of HA. All other data were unaffected. Conclusions: Cycling capacity was impaired in the heat after 5 d of consecutive HIIT HA despite some heat adaptation. Based on data, this approach is not recommended for athletes preparing to compete in the heat; however, it is possible that it may be beneficial if a state of overreaching is avoided.},

Performance was assessed by the total work (kJ) completed. TT performance was lower (P 0.05) in SLH, HTN, and HH relative to SLTN (15.4 9.7, 24.1 16.2, and 33.1 13.4 kJ, respectively). Additionally, the total work completed in HTN and HH was lower (P 0.05) than that in SLH. In SLH, HTN, and HH, work rate was reduced versus SLTN (P 0.05) within the first 3 min of exercise and was consistent for the remainder of the bout. No differences (P 0.05) existed for heart rate or Ratings of Perceived Exertion at the end of exercise among conditions. The decrease in self-paced TT performance in the heat and/or hypobaric hypoxia conditions compared with SLTN conditions resulted from a nearly immediate reduction in work rate that may have been regulated by environmentally induced changes in physiological strain and perception of effort in response to TT exercise.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between PPO and putative physiological determinants of PPO in elite cyclists, and to compare sprint performance between elite sprint and endurance cyclists. Thirty-five elite cyclists (18 endurance; 17 sprint) performed duplicate sprint cycling laboratory tests to establish PPO and its mechanical components. Quadriceps femoris (QVOL) and hamstring muscle volume (HAMVOL) were assessed with MRI, vastus lateralis pennation angle (P$\theta$VL) and fascicle length (FLVL) were determined with ultrasound imaging, and neuromuscular activation of three muscles was assessed using EMG at PPO during sprint cycling. For the whole cohort, there was a wide variability in PPO (range 775-2025 W) with very large, positive, bivariate relationships between PPO and QVOL (r =.87), HAMVOL (r =.71), and P$\theta$VL (r =.81). Step-wise multiple regression analysis revealed that 87{\%} of the variability in PPO between cyclists was explained by two variables QVOL (76{\%}) and P$\theta$VL (11{\%}). The sprint cyclists had greater PPO (+61{\%}; P {\textless}.001 vs endurance), larger QVOL (P {\textless}.001), and BFVOL (P {\textless}.001) as well as more pennate vastus lateralis muscles (P {\textless}.001).

Consecutive evenings of criterium and track racing are respectively known as speed-week or six-day events and take place in evening hours over the course of a week. Given the schedule and timing of these competitions, return to homeostasis can be compromised. No recommendations exist on how to optimize recovery for cyclists participating in these types of repeated evening competitions. Criterium and track cyclists spend considerable time, near and above the individual lactate threshold and therefore mostly utilize carbohydrate as their chief energy substrate. Henceforth, pre – and post-race nutrition and hydration is examined and recommendations are brought forward for carbohydrate, protein, and fluid intake. As evening high-intensity exercise perturbs sleep, strategies to optimize sleep are discussed and recommendations for an optimal sleep environment are given. Active recovery is examined, and the benefits of a short duration low intensity exercise reviewed. Passive recovery methods such as compression garments and cold water immersion are recommended, while evidence for massage, pneumatic compression devices, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation is still lacking. Optimizing recovery strategies will facilitate a return to the resting state following strenuous night competition.},

Methods :  Twelve elite, male cyclists performed 4 hours of cycling at 50{\%} of maximal oxygen uptake either with 3 sets of 3 × 30-second maximal sprints ( E{\&}S ) during the first 3 hours or a work-matched cycling without sprints ( E ) in a randomized order. Oxygen uptake, electromyography, and pedaling technique were recorded throughout the exercises.  Results :  GE was reduced from start to the end of exercise in both conditions ( E{\&}S : 19.0 [0.2] vs 18.1 [0.2], E : 19.1{\%} [0.2{\%}] vs 18.1{\%} [0.2{\%}], both P = .001), with no difference in change between conditions (condition × time interaction, P = .8). Integrated electromyography increased from start to end of exercise in m. vastus lateralis and m. vastus medialis (m. vastus medialis: 9.9 [2.4], m. vastus lateralis: 8.5 [4.0] mV, main effect of time: P {\textless} .001 and P = .03, respectively) and E{\&}S increased less than E in m. vastus medialis (mean difference −3.3 [1.5] mV, main effect of condition: P = .03, interaction, P = .06). The mechanical effectiveness only decreased in E{\&}S ( E{\&}S : −2.2 [0.7], effect size = 0.24 vs E: −1.3 [0.8] percentage points: P = .04 and P = .8, respectively). The mean power output during each set of 3 × 30-second sprints in E{\&}S did not differ ( P = .6).  Conclusions :  GE decreases as a function of time during 4 hours of low-intensity cycling. However, the inclusion of maximal repeated sprinting does not affect the GE changes, and the ability to sprint is maintained throughout the entire session. },

abstract = {This study aims to describe the intensity and load demands of different stage types within a cycling Grand Tour. Nine professional cyclists, whom are all part of the same World-Tour professional cycling team, participated in this investigation. Competition data were collected during the 2016 Giro d'Italia. Stages within the Grand Tour were classified into four categories: flat stages (FLAT), semi-mountainous stages (SMT), mountain stages (MT) and individual time trials (TT). Exercise intensity, measured with different heart rate and power output based variables, was highest in the TT compared to other stage types. During TT's the main proportion of time was spent at the high-intensity zone, whilst the main proportion of time was spent at low intensity for the mass start stage types (FLAT, SMT, MT). Exercise load, quantified using Training Stress Score and Training Impulse, was highest in the mass start stage types with exercise load being highest in MT (329, 359 AU) followed by SMT (280, 311 AU) and FLAT (217, 298 AU). Substantial between-stage type differences were observed in maximal mean power outputs over different durations. FLAT and SMT were characterised by higher short-duration maximal power outputs (5–30 s for FLAT, 30 s–2 min for SMT) whilst TT and MT are characterised by high longer duration maximal power outputs ({\textgreater}10 min). The results of this study contribute to the growing body of evidence on the physical demands of stage types within a cycling Grand Tour.},

Absolute (km{\textperiodcentered}h−1) and relative speed ({\%} average race speed) and speed coefficient of variation ({\%}CV) in five race sections (15.1, 31.4, 52.3, 74.4 and 100{\%} of total distance) were calculated for 8182 participants. Data were grouped and analysed according to race performance, age, sex and race experience. The highest average speed was observed in males (21.8 ± 3.7 km/h), 16–24 yr olds (23.0 ± 4.8 km/h) and those that had previously completed {\textgreater}4 Birkebeinerrittet races (22.5 ± 3.4 km/h). Independent of these factors, the fastest performers exhibited faster speeds across all race sections, whilst their relative speed was higher in early and late climbing sections (Cohen's d = 0.45–1.15) and slower in the final descending race section (d = 0.64–0.98). Similar trends were observed in the quicker age, sex and race experience groups, who tended to have a higher average speed in earlier race sections and a lower average speed during the final race section compared to slower groups. In all comparisons, faster groups also had a lower {\%}CV for speed than slower groups (fastest {\%}CV = 24.02{\%}, slowest {\%}CV = 32.03{\%}), indicating a lower variation in speed across the race. Pacing in a cross-country mountain bike marathon is related to performance, age, sex and race experience. Better performance appears to be associated with higher relative speed during climbing sections, resulting in a more consistent overall race speed.},

abstract = {This experiment was designed to estimate the optimum pedal rates at various power outputs on the cycle ergometer. Five trained bicycle racers performed five progressive maximal tests on the ergometer. Each rode at pedal rates of 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 rev X min-1. Oxygen uptake and heart rate were determined from each test and plotted against pedal rate for power outputs of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 W. Both VO2 and heart rate differed significantly among pedal rates at equivalent power outputs, the variation following a parabolic curve. The low point in the curve was taken as the optimal pedal rate; i.e., the pedal rate which elicited the lowest heart rate or VO2 for a given power output. When the optimum was plotted against power output the variation was linear. These results indicate that an optimum pedal rate exists in this group of cyclists. This optimum pedal rate increases with power output, and when our study is compared to studies in which elite racers, or non-racers were used, the optimum seems to increase with the skill of the rider.},

abstract = {The most efficient pedaling rate (lowest oxygen consumption) at a workload of 50-300 W has been reported to be in the range of 42-60 rpm. By contrast, most competitive cyclists prefer a pedaling rate of more than 90 rpm. The reason for this difference is still unknown. We assume that the high pedaling rate preferred by cyclists can be explained by the inherent properties of muscle fibers. To obtain statements which do not depend on muscle's cross-section and length, we generalized Hill's characteristic equations where muscle force and heat liberation are related to shortening velocity. A pedaling rate of f$\eta$max yields to maximal efficiency whereas the higher pedaling rate fPmax leads to maximal power. The ratio fPmax f$\eta$max between these two pedaling rates ranges from 1.7 to 2.4, and it depends on the muscle's fiber-type composition. In sprints and competitions of very short duration, fPmax is more advantageous because energy supply is not the predominant limiting factor. The price to be paid for the most powerful pedaling rate is lower efficiency and higher energy cost. In longer exercises, economy is more important and the optimal pedaling rate shifts toward f$\eta$max. We conclude that the optimal pedaling rate, representing the fastest race performance, is not fixed but depends on race duration; it ranges between f$\eta$max and fPmax. Our results are not only of interest for competitive cyclists but also for investigations using cycle ergometers: maximum power might not be reached by using a pedaling rate near the most efficient one. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of pedalling rate on cycling efficiency in road cyclists. Seven competitive road cyclists participated in the study. Four separate experimental sessions were used to determine oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) at six exercise intensities that elicited a VO2 equivalent to 54, 63, 73, 80, 87 and 93{\%} of maximum VO2 (VO(2max)). Exercise intensities were administered in random order, separated by rest periods of 3-5 min; four pedalling frequencies (60, 80, 100 and 120 rpm) were randomly tested per intensity. The oxygen cost of cycling was always lower when the exercise was performed at 60 rpm. At each exercise intensity, VO2 showed a parabolic dependence on pedalling rate (r = 0.99-l: all P {\textless} 0.01) with a curvature that flattened as intensity increased. Likewise, the relationship between power output and gross efficiency (GE) was also best fitted to a parabola (r = 0.94-l, all P {\textless} 0.05). Regardless of pedalling rate, GE improved with increasing exercise intensity (P {\textless} 0.001). Conversely, GE worsened with pedalling rate (P {\textless} 0.001). Interestingly, the effect of pedalling cadence on GE decreased as a linear function of power output (r = 0.98, n = 6, P {\textless} 0.001). Similar delta efficiency (DE) values were obtained regardless of pedalling rate (21.5 (0.8); 22.3 (1.2), 22.6 (0.6) and 73.9 (1.0){\%}, for the 60; 80, 100 and 120 rpm, mean (SEM) respectively]. However, in contrast to GE, DE increased as a linear function of pedalling rate (r = 0.98, P {\textless} 0.05). The rate at which pulmonary ventilation increased was accentuated for the highest pedalling rate (P {\textless} 0.05), even after accounting for differences in exercise intensity and VO2 (P {\textless} 0.05). Pedalling rate per se did not have any influence on heart rate which, in turn, increased linearly with VO2. These results may help us to understand why competitive cyclists often pedal at cadences of 90-105 rpm to sustain a high power output during prolonged exercise.},

abstract = {To investigate the metabolic cost and muscular actions required for the initiation and propagation of leg swing, we applied a novel combination of external forces to subjects walking on a treadmill. We applied a forward pulling force at each foot to assist leg swing, a constant forward pulling force at the waist to provide center of mass propulsion, and a combination of these foot and waist forces to evaluate leg swing. When the metabolic cost and muscle actions were at a minimum, the condition was considered optimal. We reasoned that the difference in energy consumption between the optimal combined waist and foot force trial and the optimal waist force-only trial would reflect the metabolic cost of initiating and propagating leg swing during normal walking. We also reasoned that a lower muscle activity with these assisting forces would indicate which muscles are normally responsible for initiating and propagating leg swing. With a propulsive force at the waist of 10{\%} body weight (BW), the net metabolic cost of walking decreased to 58{\%} of normal walking. With the optimal combination, a propulsive force at the waist of 10{\%} BW plus a pulling force at the feet of 3{\%} BW the net metabolic cost of walking further decreased to 48{\%} of normal walking. With the same combination, the muscle activity of the iliopsoas and reclus femoris muscles during the swing phase was 27 and 60{\%} lower, respectively, but the activity of the medial gastrocnemius and soleus before swing did not change. Thus our data indicate that ∼ 10{\%} of the net metabolic cost of walking is required to initiate and propagate teg swing. Additionally, the hip flexor muscles contribute to the initiation and propagation leg swing. {\textcopyright} 2005 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Muscles expend energy to perform active work during locomotion, but they may also expend significant energy to produce force, for example when tendons perform much of the work passively. The relative contributions of work and force to overall energy expenditure are unknown. We therefore measured the mechanics and energetics of a cyclical bouncing task, designed to control for work and force. We hypothesized that near bouncing resonance, little work would be performed actively by muscle, but the cyclical production of force would cost substantial metabolic energy. Human subjects (n = 9) bounced vertically about the ankles at inversely proportional frequencies (1-4 Hz) and amplitudes (15-4 mm), such that the overall rate of work performed on the body remained approximately constant (0.30 ± 0.06 W/kg), but the forces varied considerably. We used parameter identification to estimate series elasticity of the triceps surae tendon, as well as the work performed actively by muscle and passively by$\backslash$ tendon. Net metabolic energy expenditure for bouncing at 1 Hz was 1.15 ± 0.31 W/kg, attributable mainly to active muscle work with an efficiency of 24 ± 3{\%}. But at 3 Hz (near resonance), most of the work was performed passively, so that active muscle work could account for only 40{\%} of the net metabolic rate of 0.76 ± 0.28 W/kg. Near resonance, a cost for cyclical force that increased with both amplitude and frequency of force accounted for at least as much of the total energy expenditure as a cost for work. Series elasticity reduces the need for active work, but energy must still be expended for force production. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

No significant differences in V(O2,max) were found (mean ± S.D., 5.31 ± 0.13 l min-1). The final external power output delivered to the ergometer during incremental tests (P(I,max)) was not significantly different when cycling at 60, 80 or 100 rev min-1 (366 ± 5 W). A significant decrease in P(I,max) of {\~{}} 60 W was observed at 40 and 120 rev min-1 compared with 60 and 100 rev min-1, respectively (P {\textless} 0.01). At 120 rev min-1 there was also a pronounced upward shift of the V̇(O2)-power output (V̇(O2)-P) relationship. At 50 W $\Delta$V̇(O2) between 80 and 100 rev min-1 amounted to +0.43 l min-1 but to +0.87 l min-l between 100 and 120 rev min-1. The power output corresponding to 2 and 4 mmol l-1 blood lactate concentration (P([LA]2) and P([LA]4)) was also significantly lower ({\textgreater} 50 W) at 120 rev min-1 (P {\textless} 0.01) while pedalling at 40, 60, 80 and 100 rev min-1 showed no significant difference. The maximal peak power output (P(M,max)) during 10 s sprints increased with pedalling rate up to 100 rev min-1. Our study indicates that with increasing pedalling rate the reserves in power generating capability increase, as illustrated by the P(I,max)/P(M,max) ratio (54.8, 44.8, 38.1, 34.6, 29.2{\%}), the P([LA]4)/P(M,max) ratio (50.4, 38.9, 31.0, 27.7, 22.9{\%}) and the P([LA]2)/P(M,max) ratio (42.8, 33.5, 25.6, 23.1, 15.6{\%}) increases. Taking into consideration the V̇(O2,max), the P(I,max) and the reserve in power generating capability we concluded that choosing a high pedalling rate when performing high intensity cycling exercise may be beneficial since it provides greater reserve in power generating capability and this may be advantageous to the muscle in terms of resisting fatigue. However, beyond 100 rev min-1 there is a decrease in external power that can be delivered for an given V(O2) with an associated earlier onset of metabolic acidosis and clearly this will be disadvantageous for sustained high intensity exercise.},

abstract = {In human standing, gravity causes forward toppling about the ankle joint which is prevented by activity in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. It has long been assumed that when people sway forwards the calf muscles are stretched and conversely that they shorten with backward sway. Consequently, for many years, two explanations for standing stabilization have flourished. First, tonic muscle activity itself may generate adequate intrinsic ankle stiffness. Second, if intrinsic ankle stiffness is inadequate, the resistance to stretch of the calf muscles may be augmented by stretch reflexes or by central control. These explanations require that the passive tissue (Achilles'tendon, foot) transmitting the calf muscle tension is stiff. However, our recent measurements have indicated that this passive tissue is not stiff during standing. Accordingly, we predicted a counterintuitive mode of control where the muscles and body must, on average, move in opposite directions (paradoxical movements). Here we use dynamic ultrasound imaging in vivo with novel automated tracking of muscle length to test our hypothesis. We show that soleus and gastrocnemius do indeed move paradoxically, shortening when the body sways forward and lengthening when the body returns. This confirms that intrinsic ankle stiffness is too low to stabilize human standing. Moreover, it shows that the increase in active tension is associated with muscle shortening. This pattern cannot be produced by muscle stretch reflexes and can only arise from the anticipatory neural control of muscle length that is necessary for balance. {\textcopyright} The Physiological Society 2004.},

We review the evolutionary origins of these groups, examine three of the most prominent hypotheses for why bipedal hopping may have arisen, and discuss how this unique mode of locomotion influences the behavior and ecology of modern species. While all bipedal hoppers share generally similar body plans, differences in underlying musculoskeletal anatomy influence what performance benefits each group may derive from this mode of locomotion. Based on a review of the literature, we conclude that the most likely reason that bipedal hopping evolved is associated with predator avoidance by relatively small species in forested environments. Yet, the morphological specializations associated with this mode of locomotion have facilitated the secondary acquisition of performance characteristics that enable these species to be highly successful in ecologically demanding environments such as deserts. We refute many long-held misunderstandings about the origins of bipedal hopping and identify potential areas of research that would advance the understanding of this mode of locomotion.},

abstract = {Background: Minimization of the energetic cost of transport (CoT) has been suggested for the walk-run transition in human locomotion. More recent literature argues that lower leg muscle activities are the potential triggers of the walk-run transition. We examined both metabolic and muscular aspects for explaining walk-run transition under body weight support (BWS; supported 30{\%} of body weight) and normal walking (NW), because the BWS can reduce both leg muscle activity and metabolic rate. Methods: Thirteen healthy young males participated in this study. The energetically optimal transition speed (EOTS) was determined as the intersection between linear CoT and speed relationship in running and quadratic CoT-speed relationship in walking under BWS and NW conditions. Preferred transition speed (PTS) was determined during constant acceleration protocol (velocity ramp protocol at 0.00463 m{\textperiodcentered}s−2 ¼ 1 km{\textperiodcentered}h−1 per min) starting from 1.11 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1. Muscle activities and mean power frequency (MPF) were measured using electromyography of the primary ankle dorsiflexor (tibialis anterior; TA) and synergetic plantar flexors (calf muscles including soleus) before and after the walk-run transition. Results: The EOTS was significantly faster than the PTS under both conditions, and both were faster under BWS than in NW. In both conditions, MPF decreased after the walk-run transition in the dorsiflexor and the combined plantar flexor activities, especially the soleus. Discussion: The walk-run transition is not triggered solely by the minimization of whole-body energy expenditure. Walk-run transition is associated with reduced TA and soleus activities with evidence of greater slow twitch fiber recruitment, perhaps to avoid early onset of localized muscle fatigue.},

abstract = {Central nervous system (CNS) uses the combination of a small number of motor primitives, named muscle synergies, for simplification of motor control in human movement. The aim of this study was to investigate the muscle coordination in both leg muscles during pedaling by time-varying muscle synergy extraction. Twenty healthy subjects performed three 6-min cycling tasks over a range of rotational speed (40, 50, and 60 rpm) and resistant torque (3, 5, and 7 N/M). Surface electromyography signals were recorded during pedaling from eight muscles of the right and left lower limbs. We extracted four time-varying muscle synergies from sEMG patterns. Mean and standard deviation of the quality of the signal reconstruction (R2) for all subjects was obtained 0.9328 ± 0.0120. We investigated the similarity of muscle synergies during cycling across various mechanical conditions. We found the high degrees of similarity ({\textgreater}0.85) among the sets of time-varying muscle synergies across mechanical conditions and also across subjects. Our results show that the same motor control strategies for cycling are used by all subjects in various mechanical conditions.},

abstract = {Objectives When making a decision, humans and other animals consider both the value of the alternatives and their associated effort. Accordingly, several studies have shown that the value-functions of rewards decrease proportionally to the effort required to secure them (effort-discounting). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether and how the momentary physiological condition of the body (e.g., fatigue) influences cost-benefit computations and the evaluation of future prospects. Design Participants were asked to make a series of effort-based choices between two different effort-demanding monetary outcomes, which varied both in reward magnitudes (money) and effort (time to be spent cycling on a bicycle ergometer at submaximal performance of ∼70{\%} of Vo2max after the experimental session). The tests were performed in two conditions: when participants were fatigued versus not fatigued. Methods Visual presentation of the choice alternatives and recordings of the subjects' responses were performed using the Mouse Tracker software, which allowed the recording of the kinematics of the mouse movements associated with the choice of 20 human subjects. Results Our findings show that fatigued participants increased their preference for less-costly offers, which indicates effort-discount (i.e., decrease of participants' value functions). Kinematic analysis of participants' choices revealed the dynamical signature of this preference shift: while non-fatigued participants had a strong initial bias for the higher-value, higher-effort choice offer, this bias lacked in fatigued participants. Conclusions Our results suggest that increased fatigue levels may “scale up” effort-costs, counteracting the (otherwise default) choice of higher-valued offers. These results are relevant for the ongoing debate on whether and why fatigue impairs athletes' ability to select actions optimally.},

abstract = {During exercise, there is a progressive reduction in the ability to produce muscle force. Processes within the nervous system as well as within the muscles contribute to this fatigue. In addition to impaired function of the motor system, sensations associated with fatigue and impairment of homeostasis can contribute to the impairment of performance during exercise. This review discusses some of the neural changes that accompany exercise and the development of fatigue. The role of brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems in whole-body endurance performance is discussed, particularly with regard to exercise in hot environments. Next, fatigue-related alterations in the neuromuscular pathway are discussed in terms of changes in motor unit firing, motoneuron excitability, and motor cortical excitability. These changes have mostly been investigated during single-limb isometric contractions. Finally, the small-diameter muscle afferents that increase firing with exercise and fatigue are discussed. These afferents have roles in cardiovascular and respiratory responses to exercise, and in the impairment of exercise performance through interaction with the motor pathway, as well as in providing sensations of muscle discomfort. Thus, changes at all levels of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, motor output, sensory input, and autonomic function, occur during exercise and fatigue. The mix of influences and the importance of their contribution vary with the type of exercise being performed.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the systematic decrease of power during physical exertion gives valuable insights into health, performance, and injury. This review surveys the research of power-based models of fatigue and recovery within the area of human performance. Upon a thorough review of available literature, it is observed that the two-parameter critical power model is most popular due to its simplicity. This two-parameter model is a hyperbolic relationship between power and time with critical power as the power-asymptote and the curvature constant denoted by W′. Critical power (CP) is a theoretical power output that can be sustained indefinitely by an individual, and the curvature constant (W′) represents the amount of work that can be done above CP. Different methods and models have been validated to determine CP and W′, most of which are algebraic manipulations of the two-parameter model. The models yield different CP and W′ estimates for the same data depending on the regression fit and rounding off approximations. These estimates, at the subject level, have an inherent day-to-day variability called intra-individual variability (IIV) associated with them, which is not captured by any of the existing methods. This calls for a need for new methods to arrive at the IIV associated with CP and W′. Furthermore, existing models focus on the expenditure of W′ for efforts above CP and do not model its recovery in the sub-CP domain. Thus, there is a need for methods and models that account for (i) the IIV to measure the effectiveness of individual training prescriptions and (ii) the recovery of W′ to aid human performance optimization.},

abstract = {1. The energetic cost of work performance by mouse fast‐ and slow‐twitch muscle was assessed by measuring the rates of thermal and mechanical energy liberation of the muscles at 21 degrees C. Thermal energy (heat) liberation was measured using a fast‐responding thermopile. 2. Bundles of muscles fibres from the slow‐twitch soleus and fast‐twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were used. Work output was controlled by performing isovelocity shortenings during the plateau of an isometric tetanus. A range of shortening velocities, spanning the possible range, was used for each muscle. 3. During tetanic contractions, the rate of heat production from EDL muscle was 134.2 +/‐ 11.4 mW/g. The rate of heat production by soleus muscle was only one‐fifth as great (26.8 +/‐ 2.7 mW/g). 4. The maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) of EDL muscles was 2.5‐fold greater than that for soleus muscles and it's force‐velocity relationship was less curved. Peak power output from EDL muscles was 3‐fold greater than that from soleus muscle. 5. During shortening, the rate of heat output from soleus muscles increased considerably above the isometric heat rate. In contrast to soleus muscle, the rate of heat production by EDL muscle increased by only a small fraction of the isometric heat rate. The magnitude of the increases in rate was proportional to shortening velocity. 6. The total rate of energy liberation (heat rate + power) by EDL muscle, shortening at 0.95 Vmax was 1.62 +/‐ 0.37 times greater than the isometric heat rate. In contrast, the rate of energy liberation from soleus muscle shortening at 0.95 Vmax was 5.21 +/‐ 0.58 times greater than its isometric heat rate. The peak mechanical efficiency (power/total energy rate) of the both muscles was approximately 30{\%}. {\textcopyright} 1993 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {In any athletic event, the ability to appropriately distribute energy is essential to prevent premature fatigue prior to the completion of the event. In sport science literature this is termed "pacing." Within the past decade, research aiming to better understand the underlying mechanisms influencing the selection of an athlete's pacing during exercise has dramatically increased. It is suggested that pacing is a combination of anticipation, knowledge of the end-point, prior experience and sensory feedback. In order to better understand the role each of these factors have in the regulation of pace, studies have often manipulated various conditions known to influence performance such as the feedback provided to participants, the starting strategy or environmental conditions. As with all research there are several factors that should be considered in the interpretation of results from these studies. Thus, this review aims at discussing the pacing literature examining the manipulation of: (i) energy expenditure and pacing strategies, (ii) kinematics or biomechanics, (iii) exercise environment, and (iv) fatigue development.},

abstract = {Background: Much is known about theoretical bases of different mechanical efficiency indices and effects of physiological and biomechanical factors to them. However, there are only a few studies available about practical bases and interactions between these efficiency indices, which were the aims of the present study. Methods: Fourteen physically active men (n = 12) and women (n = 2) participated in this study. From the incremental test, six different mechanical efficiency indices were calculated for cycling work: gross (GE) and net (NE) efficiencies, two work efficiencies (WE), and economy (T) at 150 W, and in addition delta efficiency (DE) using 3–5 observation points. Results: It was found that the efficiency indices can be divided into three groups by Spearman's rank correlation: GE, T, and NE in group I; DE and extrapolated WE in group II; and measured WE in group III. Furthermore, group II appeared to have poor reliability due to its dependence on a work-expended energy regression line, which accuracy is poorly measured by confidence interval. Conclusion: As efficiency indices fall naturally into three classes that do not interact with each other, it means that they measure fundamentally different aspects of mechanical efficiency. Based on problems and imprecisions with other efficiency indices, GE, or group I, seems to be the best indicator for mechanical efficiency because of its consistency and unambiguity. Based on this methodological analysis, the baseline subtractions in efficiency indices are not encouraged.},

abstract = {Objectives: It is not uncommon for athletes to be diagnosed with iron deficiency, yet there remains uncertainty whether the prevalence of suboptimal iron status in elite athletes differs from the normal population or warrants routine screening. The purpose of this study is to describe the distribution of serum ferritin (SF) in a cohort of elite athletes. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Electronic health records of 1085 elite adult athletes (570 women, 515 men) from 2012–2017 were examined retrospectively. SF values were compared to published normal population data. The proportion of athletes meeting criterion values for iron deficiency or initiation of treatment was examined. Results: SF distributions in male athletes were significantly lower than normal males aged 20 to {\textless}24 yrs. ($\chi$2 28.8, p {\textless} 0.001) and aged 24 to {\textless}28 yrs. ($\chi$2 91.9, p {\textless} 0.001). SF status was similar in female athletes and normal women aged 20 to {\textless}24 yrs. ($\chi$2 9.5, p {\textgreater} 0.05) or aged 24 to {\textless}28 yrs. ($\chi$2 11.5, p {\textgreater} 0.05). Using 35 ng/ml as the criterion value for stage one iron deficiency, 15{\%} of male athletes and 52{\%} of female athletes displayed suboptimal iron status. Conclusions: Male athletes have a significantly lower population distribution of SF values as compared to normative data on healthy males, with 15{\%} of male athletes having suboptimal SF status. The distribution of SF values in elite female athletes did not differ from population values, however approximately half women athletes were iron deficient. These data suggest that iron screening should be considered in both male and female athlete populations.},

abstract = {Estimates of muscular efficiency in competitive and recreational cyclists at similar work intensities and cycling frequencies were examined. Twelve healthy college-age male nonsmoker volunteers were grouped as either competitive (CC; N=6) or recreational (RC; N=6) cyclists based upon previous cycling experience. Subjects were studied at pedaling frequencies of 50 and 80 rpm during bouts of graded and submaximal endurance (75{\%} V̇O(2peak)) exercise. Between rest and 250 W, we observed no intergroup differences in V̇O2(energy input) at either 50 or 80 rpm. Estimates of whole body (gross) muscular efficiency ranged from 15{\%} to 24{\%} in competitive and 13{\%} to 22{\%} in recreational cyclists at 50 rpm but were not different. Delta ($\Delta$) efficiencies ranged from 20{\%} to 34{\%} in competitive and from 21{\%} to 28{\%} in recreational cyclists. Delta efficiency decreased from 27{\%} to 21{\%} in competitive cyclists, from 25{\%} to 21{\%} in recreational cyclists as a function of pedaling frequency, and was not different between groups. Competitive cyclists rode longer at both 50 rpm (27 ± 5 min vs 14 ± 2 min; P {\textless} 0.05) and 80 rpm (35 ± 4 min vs 20 ± min; P {\textless} 0.05). At 50 rpm (3.08 ± 0.02 l {\textperiodcentered} min-1vs 2.78 ± 0.05 l {\textperiodcentered} min-1; P {\textless} 0.01) and 80 rpm (3.14 ± 0.01 l {\textperiodcentered} min-1vs 2.7 ± 0.04 l {\textperiodcentered} min-1; P {\textless} 0.001), the mean V̇O2was also greater in competitive cyclists. Although both groups showed superior endurance at 80 compared with 50 rpm and total work was approximately double competitive cyclists at each pedaling frequency, we observed no differences in whole body muscular efficiency during sustained exercise at 75{\%} V̇O(2peak). Our results suggested that previous cycling experience was of minor importance when comparing cycle ergometer efficiency between these two groups. The increased endurance at higher pedaling frequencies during submaximal exercise is not explained by altered muscular efficiency.},

abstract = {The effective lumped stiffness and damping ratio of the human leg system was determined from measurements of parallel and antiparallel-mode oscillations while standing on a linear spring. Knee flexion angle was held fixed in each trial, and varied systematically from 0" to 75'. At each knee angle, subjects carried weights up to twice body weight on their shoulders to determine the effect of increasing muscle force. For small knee flexion angles (0 I 30'). reflex stiffness was independent of muscle force, but rose slightly with muscle force for large flexions. The damping ratio was calculated to be 0.34, showing the underdamped character often reported for skeletomotor reflex mechanisms. Leg stiffness measured in this way is consistent with measurements taken during human running. IbTRODUCTION Perhaps the simplest conceivable mechanical model of a man running would include just two elements: a mass equal to the body weight of the man, and a damped spring whose stiffness constant is equivalent to the average reflex stiffness of the man's leg. Under these circumstances, half of the period of vibration of such a damped mass-spring system can be directly associated with the foot contact time ofthe man during running (McMahon and Greene, 1979). In a previous paper (McMahon and Greene, 1979) we show that this damped mass-spring model predicts man's reflex stiffness constant during running to be of the order of 5000{\~{}}80001bf/ft (73-117 kN/m). This prediction is made on the basis of experimentally observed foot contact times from human subjects. However, intuition would suggest that the overall reflex stiffness of the human leg depends on knee angle, foot force, mechanical properties of the running surface and running speed. Knee angle and foot force are functions of time during running, and therefore only an average reflex stiffness may be defined over a stride cycle. In this paper, we set the task of measuring the reflex stiffness of the human leg under conditions of constant knee angle and foot force, to discover how each ofthese variables affects reflex stiffness separately. The concept of representing muscles as linear springs is not without precedent. Houk (1976) concludes that controlled muscular action about a joint (such as the knee) is well represented by a "rack-and-pinion" positioning element in series with a spring. The rack-and-pinion can be controlled purposefully by the individual in moving the limbs through large displace-* {\$} Professor of Applied Mechanics and Biology. ments. However, rapid fluctuations in force level imposed by the environment elicit response only from the spring-like reflex system. Cavagna (1970) concludes that the overall reflex stiffness of man's ankle extensor system is typically in the range from 2300 to 2800 lbf/ft (34-41 kN/m). Furthermore, the damping action ofthe muscle groups about the ankle implies the existence ofa dashpot element (ofdamping ratio 0.2) in parallel with the reflex spring element (Cavagna, 1970). One technique for measuring the overall mechanical properties of a muscle system is to link that system to an external mass, spring, dashpot, or any combination of the three, and observe how such external impedances change the dynamics of the system. Bawa et al. (1976) performed such experiments on cat plantaris muscle. They concluded an overall spring stiffness for the muscle of 42.0 Ibf/ft (0.61 kN/m). In this paper weattempt to determine the overall leg spring stiffness of man in ciao by having subjects execute small amplitude oscillations while standing on an external mass-spring system. Observation of the resonant frequency of this coupled two-mass two-spring system implies a value for man's spring stiffness. The posture assumed by the subject during these oscillations is similar to the posture found at mid-stance during running. The expectation is that leg stiffness data measured by this technique will be consistent with observed foot contact times recorded during actual human running. Simple theoretical arguments are presented herein to explain how overall leg stiffness varies with knee angle, and how resonant frequency of this coupled system depends on the external mass and spring. Moreover, the observed existence of both a parallel and an anti-parallel vibration mode of this two-mass two-spring system allows a theoretical estimate of the overall damping constant appropriate for reflex control of flexion-extension of the leg.},

abstract = {Importance: Concussion on university campuses is a significant health problem. Characterizing the incidence of concussion on college campuses may inform education and resource allocation policy at student health care centers. Objectives: To establish a measure of concussion incidence among collegiate undergraduate students and to describe characteristics associated with concussion incidence, including sex, cause, and month. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included data from 3 academic years from August 2015 to April 2018 at a large, public university in the United States. Participants included any undergraduate student or varsity athlete who was diagnosed with at least 1 concussion during the academic year. Exposures: Sport- and non-sport-related activities of undergraduate students. Main Outcomes and Measures: Concussion diagnosis. Results: Among 954 undergraduate students from the general undergraduate population with at least 1 concussion, including 502 men and 452 women, 1020 concussions were diagnosed in 3 academic years. During 2 academic years, a total of 80 concussions occurred among the varsity athlete population, including 26 men and 54 women. Overall, concussion incidence among both the general undergraduate population and varsity athletes was 132.4 (95{\%} CI, 123.2-142.0) concussions per 10 000 students. Men sustained concussions at a rate of 126.1 (95{\%} CI, 114.1-139.0) concussions per 10 000 students and women sustained concussions at a rate of 140.0 (95{\%} CI, 126.2-155.3) concussions per 10 000 students for the 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 academic years. Concussion incidence peaked in August at the start of the academic year and the rate of non-sport-related concussions (81.0 [95{\%} CI, 73.9-88.7] concussions per 10 000 students for academic years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018) was higher than the rate of sport-related concussions (51.5 [95{\%} CI, 49.5-57.7] concussions per 10 000 students for academic years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found concussions to be common among this US collegiate population. While concussion is often associated with sport, the incidence of non-sport-related concussion was higher than that of sport-related concussion throughout the academic year.

abstract = {In Asia, flexible bamboo poles are routinely used to carry substantial loads on the shoulder. Various advantages have been attributed to this load-carrying strategy (e.g. reduced energy consumption), but experimental evidence remains inconsistent - possibly because carriers in previous studies were inexperienced. Theoretical models typically neglect the individual's capacity to optimize interactions with the oscillating load, leaving the complete dynamics underexplored. This study used a trajectory optimization model to predict gait adaptations that minimize work-based costs associated with carrying compliant loads and compared the outcomes with naturally selected gait adaptations of experienced pole carriers. Gait parameters and load interactions (e.g. relative amplitude and frequency, phase) were measured in rural farmworkers in Vietnam. Participants carried a range of loads with compliant and rigid poles and the energetic consequences of step frequency adjustments were evaluated using the model. When carrying large loads, the empirical step frequency changes associated with pole type (compliant versus rigid) were largely consistent with model predictions, in terms of direction (increase or decrease) and magnitude (by how much). Work-minimizing strategies explain changes in leg compliance, harmonic frequency oscillations and fluctuations in energetic cost associated with carrying loads on a compliant bamboo pole.},

abstract = {An important function of skeletal muscle is deceleration via active muscle fascicle lengthening, which dissipates movement energy. The mechanical interplay between muscle contraction and tendon elasticity is critical when muscles produce energy. However, the role of tendon elasticity during muscular energy dissipation remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that tendon elasticity functions as a mechanical buffer, preventing high (and probably damaging) velocities and powers during active muscle fascicle lengthening. We directly measured lateral gastrocnemius muscle force and length in wild turkeys during controlled landings requiring rapid energy dissipation. Muscle-tendon unit (MTU) strain was measured via video kinematics, independent of muscle fascicle strain (measured via sonomicrometry). We found that rapid MTU lengthening immediately following impact involved little or no muscle fascicle lengthening. Therefore, joint flexion had to be accommodated by tendon stretch. After the early contact period, muscle fascicles lengthened and absorbed energy. This late lengthening occurred after most of the joint flexion, and was thus mainly driven by tendon recoil. Temporary tendon energy storage led to a significant reduction in muscle fascicle lengthening velocity and the rate of energy absorption. We conclude that tendons function as power attenuators that probably protect muscles against damage from rapid and forceful lengthening during energy dissipation. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Background. Successful execution of a task as simple as drinking from a cup and as complicated as cutting food with a fork and knife requires accurate perception of the torques that one generates in each arm. Prior studies have shown that individuals with hemiparetic stroke inaccurately judge their self-generated torques during bimanual tasks; yet, it remains unclear whether these individuals inaccurately judge their self-generated torques during unimanual tasks. Objective. The goal of this work was to determine whether stroke affected how accurately individuals with stroke perceive their self-generated torques during a single-arm task. Methods. Fifteen individuals with hemiparetic stroke and fifteen individuals without neurological impairments partook in this study. Participants generated a target torque about their testing elbow while receiving visual feedback, relaxed, and then matched the target torque about the same elbow without receiving feedback. This task was performed for two target torques (5 Nm, 25{\%} of maximum voluntary torque), two movement directions (flexion, extension), and two arms (left, right). Results. Clinical assessments indicate that eleven participants with stroke had kinaesthetic deficits and two had altered pressure sense; their motor impairments spanned from mild to severe. These participants matched torques at each elbow, for each target torque and movement direction, with a similar accuracy and precision to controls, regardless of the arm tested (p{\textgreater}0.050). Conclusions. These results indicate that an individual with sensorimotor deficits post-hemiparetic stroke may accurately judge the torques that they generate within each arm. Therefore, while survivors of a hemiparetic stroke may have deficits in accurately judging the torques they generate during bimanual tasks, such deficits do not appear to occur during unimanual tasks.},

abstract = {Background: Prior work indicates that 50–75{\%} of individuals post-hemiparetic stroke have upper-extremity weakness and, in turn, inaccurately judge the relative torques that their arms generate during a bimanual task. Recent findings also reveal that these individuals judge the relative torques their arms generate differently depending on whether they reference their paretic vs. non-paretic arm. Objective: Our goal was to determine whether individuals with hemiparetic stroke inaccurately matched torques between arms, regardless of the arm that they referenced. Methods: Fifteen participants with hemiparetic stroke and 10 right-hand dominant controls matched torques between arms. Participants performed this task with their right arm referencing their left arm, and vice versa. Participants generated (1) 5 Nm and (2) 25{\%} of their reference elbow's maximum voluntary torque (MVT) in flexion and extension using their reference arm while receiving audiovisual feedback. Then, participants matched the reference torque using their opposite arm without receiving feedback on their matching performance. Results: Participants with stroke had greater magnitudes of error in matching torques than controls when referencing their paretic arm (p {\textless} 0.050), yet not when referencing their non-paretic arm (p {\textgreater} 0.050). The mean magnitude of error when participants with stroke referenced their paretic and non-paretic arm and controls referenced their dominant and non-dominant arm to generate 5 Nm in flexion was 9.4, 2.6, 4.2, and 2.5 Nm, respectively, and in extension was 5.3, 2.8, 2.5, and 2.3 Nm, respectively. However, when the torques generated at each arm were normalized by the corresponding MVT, no differences were found in matching errors regardless of the arm participants referenced (p {\textgreater} 0.050). Conclusions: Results demonstrate the importance of the arm referenced, i.e., paretic vs. non-paretic, on how accurately individuals post-hemiparetic stroke judge their torques during a bimanual task. Results also indicate that individuals with hemiparetic stroke judge torques primarily based on their perceived effort. Finally, findings support the notion that training individuals post-hemiparetic stroke to accurately perceive their self-generated torques, with a focus of their non-paretic arm in relation to their paretic arm, may lead to an improved ability to perform bimanual activities of daily living.},

abstract = {This study investigated the variation in freely chosen pedal rate between subjects and its possible dependence on percentage myosin heavy chain I ({\%}MHC I) in m. vastus lateralis, maximum leg strength and power, as well as efficiency. Additionally, the hypothesis was tested that a positive correlation exists between percentage MHC I and efficiency at pre-set pedal rates but not at freely chosen pedal rate. Twenty males performed cycling at low and high submaximal power output (∼40 and 70{\%} of the power output at which maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was attained at 80 r.p.m.) with freely chosen and pre-set pedal rates (61, 88, and 115 r.p.m.). Percentage MHC I as well as leg strength and power were determined. Freely chosen pedal rate varied considerably between subjects: 56-88 r.p.m. at low and 61-102 r.p.m. at high submaximal power output. This variation was only partly explained by percentage MHC I (21-97{\%}) as well as by leg strength and power. Interestingly, {\%}MHC I correlated significantly with the pedal rate at which maximum peak crank power occurred ( = -0.81). As hypothesized, {\%}MHC I and efficiency were unrelated at freely chosen pedal rate, which was in contrast to a significant correlation found at pre-set pedal rates ( = 0.61 and = 0.57 at low and high power output, respectively). Conclusions: Subjects with high percentage MHC I chose high pedal rates close to the pedal rates at which maximum peak crank power occurred, while subjects with low percentage MHC I tended to choose lower pedal rates, favouring high efficiency. Nevertheless, the considerable variation in freely chosen pedal rate between subjects was neither fully accounted for by percentage MHC I nor by leg strength and power. Previously recognized relationships between percentage Type I (∼{\%}MHC I) and efficiency as well as between pedal rate and efficiency were confirmed for pre-set pedal rates, but for freely chosen pedal rate, these variables were unrelated.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of gradient on cycling gross efficiency and pedaling technique. Methods: Eighteen trained cyclists were tested for efficiency, index of pedal force effectiveness (IFE), distribution of power production during the pedal revolution (dead center size [DC]), and timing and level of muscle activity of eight leg muscles. Cycling was performed on a treadmill at gradients of 0{\%} (level), 4{\%}, and 8{\%}, each at three different cadences (60, 75, and 90 rev{\textperiodcentered}min-1). Results: Efficiency was significantly decreased at a gradient of 8{\%} compared with both 0{\%} and 4{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). The relationship between cadence and efficiency was not changed by gradient (P {\textgreater} 0.05). At a gradient of 8{\%}, there was a larger IFE between 45 and 225 and larger DC, compared with 0{\%} and 4{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). The onset of muscle activity for vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, and gastrocnemius medialis occurred earlier with increasing gradient (all P {\textless} 0.05), whereas none of the muscles showed a change in offset (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Uphill cycling increased the overall muscle activity level (P {\textless} 0.05), mainly induced by increased calf muscle activity. Conclusions: These results suggest that uphill cycling decreases cycling gross efficiency and is associated with changes in pedaling technique.

abstract = {The authors addressed the hypothesis that economy in motor coordination is a learning phenomenon realized by both reduced energy cost for a given workload and more external work at the same prepractice metabolic and attentional energy expenditure. "Self-optimization" of movement parameters has been proposed to reflect learned motor adaptations that minimize energy costs. Twelve men aged 22.3 ± 3.9 years practiced a 90° relative phase, upper limb, independent ergometer cycling task at 60 rpm, followed by a transfer test of unpracticed (45 and 75 rpm) and self-paced cadences. Performance in all conditions was initially unstable, inaccurate, and relatively high in both metabolic and attentional energy costs. With practice, coordinative stability increased, more work was performed for the same metabolic and attentional costs, and the same work was done at a reduced energy cost. Self-paced cycling was initially below the metabolically optimal, but following practice at 60 rpm was closer to optimal cadence. Given the many behavioral options of the motor system in meeting a variety of everyday movement task goals, optimal metabolic and attentional energy criteria may provide a solution to the problem of selecting the most adaptive coordination and control parameters.

Whereas the trauma associated with footstrike is thought to be the major cause of hemolysis after running, its significance compared with hemolysis that results from other circulatory stresses on the red blood cell has not been thoroughly addressed. To investigate the significance of footstrike, we measured the degree of hemolysis after 1 h of running. To control for the potential effects of oxidative and circulatory stresses on the red blood cell, the same subjects cycled for 1 h at equivalent oxygen uptake. Our subjects were 10 male triathletes, who each completed two separate 1-h sessions of running and cycling at 75{\%} peak oxygen uptake, which were performed in random order 1 wk apart. Plasma free hemoglobin and serum haptoglobin concentrations were measured as indicators of hemolysis. We also measured methemoglobin as a percentage of total hemoglobin immediately postexercise as an indicator of red cell oxidative stress. Plasma free hemoglobin increased after both running (P {\textless} 0.01) and cycling (P {\textless} 0.01), but the increase was fourfold greater after running (P {\textless} 0.01). This was reflected by a significant fall in haptoglobin 1 h after the running trials, whereas no significant changes occurred after cycling at any sample point. Methemoglobin increased twofold after both running and cycling (P {\textless} 0.01), with no significant differences between modes of exercise. The present data indicate that, whereas general circulatory trauma to the red blood cells associated with 1 h of exercise at 75{\%} maximal oxygen uptake may result in some exercise-induced hemolysis, footstrike is the major contributor to hemolysis during running.},

abstract = {Maximal anaerobic power (Pmax) is often measured on a friction loaded cycle ergometer by means of an all-out exercise against a single braking force or from the force-velocity relationship. The relationship between braking force (F) and peak velocity (V) in cycling is linear: V=V0(1-F/F0) where V0 and F0 correspond to the intercepts with the velocity axis and force axis, respectively. The aim of the present paper was to test the hypothesis that parameter F0 expresses strength ability. The first study (12 male volleyball players) showed significant correlations between F0 and maximal isometric voluntary force (MVF) or maximal isometric rate of force development (MRFD) during isometric knee extension with data expressed either in absolute units (0.66 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.81, P {\textless} 0.07) or related to quadriceps muscle mass kgQ or kgQ2/3 (0.58 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.82, 0.05 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.001). In the second study (24 male athletes), F0 was significantly correlated with the peak torques in isokinetic Biodex knee extension at four angular velocities (0, 1.57, 3.14 and 4.19 rad {\textperiodcentered} s-1) with the values expressed in absolute units (0.49 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.83, 0.05 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.001). When the results were related to kgQ or kgQ2/3 the correlation coefficients increased with velocity (0.22 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.69) and were significant (0.05 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.001) except at 0 rod {\textperiodcentered} s-1. Nevertheless, the interest of the determination of F0 in addition to Pmax is questionable because similar coefficients of correlation were obtained between Pmax and strength performances.},

Method: Ten physically active men (mean (SD) age 19.1 (1.10) years) who were unfamiliar with aerobars underwent maximal exercise testing and steady state cycling at 50, 100, and 150 W. Results: Participants had significantly greater maxima for oxygen uptake (VO2), ventilation, heart rate, and workload maximum in the upright position. During steady state cycling at the three workloads, VO2 (ml/kg/min) and gross mechanical efficiency were significantly greater in the upright position. Conclusions: In untrained subjects performing with maximal effort, the upright position permits greater VO2, ventilation, heart rate, and workload maxima. Further, in the steady state, exercise cycling may be less costly in the upright position. For this reason, untrained cyclists need to weigh body position effects against the well known aerodynamic advantages of the aero position.},

Supine exercise produced significant decreases in left ventricular ejection time (LVET), and pre ejection period (PEP), and isovolumic contraction time (IVCT). Ejection time index (ETI) and 'corrected ejection time' (LVETc) did not change significantly. Upright exercise produced greater decreases in PEP and LVET, but despite the rate increase there was no change in LVET, which resulted in sharp increases in ETI and LVETc. The discordant directional effects on LVET and its rate correcting indices between the two postures were consistent with hemodynamic studies demonstrating lack of stroke volume change during supine exercise and increased stroke volume over control during light to moderate upright exercise. Concordant effects on PEP and IVCT are consistent with the inotropic effect of exercise in both postures with an additional Frank Starling effect postulated during upright exercise.},

Twelve healthy young (age, 19-31 yr) and 12 healthy elderly (age, 60-82 yr) women performed bilateral and unilateral knee-hip extension movements on the dynamometer against loads controlled by the servo system. Under the isotonic force condition, force-velocity relationships were measured. The maximum isometric force (Fmax), unloaded velocity (Vmax) and power output (Pmax) of the movements were calculated from extrapolating force-velocity and force-power relationships. Fmax and Pmax of bilateral and unilateral knee-hip extension movements were 20-30{\%} lower in elderly than in young women. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in Vmax between young and elderly women and between bilateral and unilateral movements. Bilateral deficit was larger as the generation of force was larger in both young and elderly women. Also, bilateral deficit of Fmax and Pmax were not different between young and elderly women. The results were that lower maximum power output of bilateral and unilateral leg multi-joint movements in elderly women did not depend on the intrinsic shortening velocity of muscle action, but largely on reduction in force generating capacity. This suggests the importance of preventing a loss of force generating capacity of muscles during leg multi-joint movements in elderly women. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Saddle position affects mechanical variables during submaximal cycling, but little is known about its effect on mechanical performance during maximal cycling. Therefore, this study relates saddle position to experimentally obtained maximal power output and theoretically calculated moment generating capacity of hip, knee and ankle muscles during isokinetic cycling. Ten subjects performed maximal cycling efforts (5 s at 100 rpm) at different saddle positions varying ± 2 cm around the in literature suggested optimal saddle position (109{\%} of inner leg length), during which crank torque and maximal power output were determined. In a subgroup of 5 subjects, lower limb kinematics were additionally recorded during submaximal cycling at the different saddle positions. A decrease in maximal power output was found for lower saddle positions. Recorded changes in knee kinematics resulted in a decrease in moment generating capacity of biceps femoris, rectus femoris and vastus intermedius at the knee. No differences in muscle moment generating capacity were found at hip and ankle. Based on these results we conclude that lower saddle positions are less optimal to generate maximal power output, as it mainly affects knee joint kinematics, compromising mechanical performance of major muscle groups acting at the knee. {\textcopyright} 2011 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

It was hypothesized that expressing running economy in terms of caloric unit cost would be more sensitive to changes in speed than oxygen cost by accounting for differences associated with substrate utilization. Sixteen highly trained male distance runners [maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) 66.5 ± 5.6 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg -1{\textperiodcentered}min-1, body mass 67.9 ± 7.3 kg, height 177.6 ± 7.0 cm, age 24.6 ± 5.0 yr] ran on a motorized treadmill for 5 min with a gradient of 0{\%} at speeds corresponding to 75{\%}, 85{\%}, and 95{\%} of speed at lactate threshold with 5-min rest between stages. Oxygen uptake was measured via open-circuit calorimetry. Average oxygen cost was 221 ± 19, 217 ± 15, and 221 ± 13 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}km -1, respectively. Caloric unit cost was 1.05 ± 0.09, 1.07 ± 0.08, and 1.11 ± 0.07 kcal{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}km -1 at the three trial speeds, respectively. There was no difference in oxygen cost with respect to speed (P = 0.657); however, caloric unit cost significantly increased with speed (P {\textless} 0.001). It was concluded that expression of running economy in terms of caloric unit cost is more sensitive to changes in speed and is a more valuable expression of running economy than oxygen uptake, even when normalized per distance traveled.

abstract = {The biomechanical and metabolic demands of human running are distinctly affected by velocity and body weight. As runners increase velocity, ground reaction forces (GRF) increase, which may increase the risk of an overuse injury, and more metabolic power is required to produce greater rates of muscular force generation. Running with weight support attenuates GRFs, but demands less metabolic power than normal weight running. We used a recently developed device (G-trainer) that uses positive air pressure around the lower body to support body weight during treadmill running. Our scientific goal was to quantify the separate and combined effects of running velocity and weight support on GRFs and metabolic power. After obtaining this basic data set, we identified velocity and weight support combinations that resulted in different peak GRFs, yet demanded the same metabolic power. Ideal combinations of velocity and weight could potentially reduce biomechanical risks by attenuating peak GRFs while maintaining aerobic and neuromuscular benefits. Indeed, we found many combinations that decreased peak vertical GRFs yet demanded the same metabolic power as running slower at normal weight. This approach of manipulating velocity and weight during running may prove effective as a training and/or rehabilitation strategy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

The first problem is that sensory feedback is noisy and delayed, which can make movements inaccurate and unstable. The second problem is that the relationship between a motor command and the movement it produces is variable, as the body and the environment can both change. A solution is to build adaptive internal models of the body and the world. The predictions of these internal models, called forward models because they transform motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both pro-duce a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the world around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce unbiased predictions. Evidence shows that forward models remain calibrated through motor adaptation: learning driven by sensory prediction errors.},

The brain may control complex movements through flexible combination of motor primitives, where each primitive is an element of computation in the sensorimotor map that transforms desired limb trajectories into motor commands. Theoretical studies have shown that a system's ability to learn action depends on the shape of its primitives. Using a time-series analysis of error patterns, here we show that humans learn the dynamics of reaching movements through a flexible combination of primitives that have gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity. The wide tuning of the inferred primitives predicts limitations on the brain's ability to represent viscous dynamics. We find close agreement between the predicted limitations and the subjects' adaptation to new force fields. The mathematical properties of the derived primitives resemble the tuning curves of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The activity of these cells may encode primitives that underlie the learning of dynamics.},

abstract = {Current models of motor learning suggest that multiple timescales support adaptation to changes in visual or mechanical properties of the environment. These models capture patterns of learning and memory across a broad range of tasks, yet do not consider the possibility that rapid changes in behavior may occur without adaptation. Such changes in behavior may be desirable when facing transient disturbances, or when unpredictable changes in visual or mechanical properties of the task make it difficult to form an accurate model of the perturbation. Whether humans can modulate control strategies without an accurate model of the perturbation remains unknown. Here we frame this question in the context of robust control (H∞-control), a control strategy that specifically considers unpredictable disturbances by increasing initial movement speed and feedback gains. Correspondingly, we demonstrate in two human reaching experiments including males and females that the occurrence of a single unpredictable disturbance led to an increase in movement speed and in the gain of rapid feedback responses to mechanical disturbances on subsequent movements. This strategy reduced perturbation-related motion regardless of the direction of the perturbation. Furthermore, we found that changes in the control strategy were associated with co-contraction, which amplified the gain of muscle responses to both lengthening and shortening perturbations. These results have important implications for studies on motor adaptation because they highlight that trial-by-trial changes in limb motion also reflected changes in control strategies dissociable from error-based adaptation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans and animals use internal representations of movement dynamics to anticipate the impact of predictable disturbances. However, we are often confronted with transient or unpredictable disturbances, and it remains unknown whether and how the nervous system handles these disturbances over fast time scales. Here we hypothesized that humans can modulate their control strategy to make reaching movements less sensitive to perturbations. We tested this hypothesis in the framework of robust control, and found changes in movement speed and feedback gains consistent with the model predictions. These changes impacted participants' behavior on a trial-by-trial basis. We conclude that compensation for disturbances over fast time scales involves a robust control strategy, which potentially plays a key role in motor planning and execution.},

Simultaneously one can also control the lateral position of the base: changing of the track line of a bike or the position of hand under a balanced stick. We show here with theory and experiment that if the balance problem is removed, by making the system neutrally stable for balance, one cannot simultaneously maintain balance and control the position of the base. We made a bricycle, essentially a bicycle with springy training wheels. The stiffness of the training wheel suspension can be varied from near infinite, making the bricycle into a tricycle, to zero, making it effectively a bicycle. The springy training wheels effectively reduce or even negate gravity, at least for balance purposes. One might expect a smooth transition from tricycle to bicycle as the stiffness is varied, in terms of handling, balance and feel. Not so. At an intermediate stiffness, when gravity is effectively zeroed, riders can balance easily but no longer turn. Small turns cause an intolerable leaning. Thus there is a qualitative difference between bicycles and tricycles, a difference that cannot be met halfway.},

abstract = {Introduction From the perspective of dynamic systems theory, stability and variability of biological signals are both understood as a functional adaptation to variable environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined whether this theoretical perspective is applicable to the pedalling movement in cycling. Non-linear measures were applied to analyse pedalling forces with varying levels of subjective load. Materials and methods Ten subjects completed a 13-sector virtual terrain profile of 15 km total length on a roller trainer with varying degrees of virtual terrain inclination (resistance). The test was repeated two times with different instructions on how to alter the bikes gearing. During the experiment, pedalling force and heart rate were measured. Force-time curves were sequenced into single cycles, linearly interpolated in the time domain, and z-score normalised. The established time series was transferred into a two-dimensional phase space with limit cycle properties given the applied 25{\%} phase shift. Different representations of the phase space attractor were calculated within each sector and used as non-linear measures assessing pedalling forces. Results and discussion A contrast analysis showed that changes in pedalling load were strongly associated to changes in non-linear phase space attractor variables. For the subjects investigated in this study, this association was stronger than that between heart rate and resistance level. The results indicate systematic changes of the pedalling movement as an adaptive response to an externally determined increase in workload. Future research may utilise the findings from this study to investigate possible relationships between subjective measures of exhaustion, comfort, and discomfort with biomechanic characteristics of the pedalling movement and to evaluate connections with dynamic stability measures.},

abstract = {Previous studies evaluated cycling with noncircular chainrings and suggested that changes in muscle activation would occur in response to altered pedaling mechanics throughout the crank arm revolution. However, no previous study addressed this question. The aim of this study was to compare the magnitude of muscular activity between a conventional and a noncircular crank system during an incremental maximal cycling test. Seven mountain-bike trained cyclists completed two incremental maximal tests, separated by 48. h, one for each crank system. Each test started with a workload of 100. W and was increased by 30. W every minute until exhaustion. Power output, pedaling cadence and heart rate were monitored and compared between the crank systems using paired t-tests. Surface EMG was recorded from the right rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius medialis. EMG was compared using a general linear model considering as factors the crank system and workload with post hoc analysis at $\alpha$=0.05. RMS presented effect of workload, but no effect of crank system was found for the muscles analyzed. The present results do not support effects of the noncircular crank system on variables of performance and muscle activation during incremental cycling in trained mountain bike cyclists. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The main aim of this project was to study muscle activity patterns during steep uphill cycling (UC) (i.e., with a gradient of 20{\%}) with (1) normal saddle geometry and (2) with adjusted saddle position ASP (i.e., moving the saddle forward and changing the tilt of the saddle by 20{\%}). Based on our preliminary case study, we hypothesized that: (1) during 20{\%} UC muscle activity patterns would be different from those of level cycling (LC) and (2) during 20{\%} UC with ASP muscle activity patterns would resemble those of LC. Twelve trained male cyclists were tested on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer under three conditions with the same work rate (80{\%} of maximal power output) and cadence (90. rpm): level (LC), 20{\%} UC and 20{\%} UC with ASP. Electromyographic signals were acquired from m. tibialis anterior (TA), m. soleus (SO), m. gastrocnemius (GC), m. vastus lateralis (VL), m. vastus medialis (VM), m. rectus femoris (RF), m. biceps femoris (BF) and m. gluteus maximus (GM). Compared to LC, 20{\%} UC significantly modified both the timing and the intensity of activity of the selected muscles, while muscles that cross the hip joint were the most affected (RF later onset, earlier offset, shorter range of activity and decrease in peak amplitude of 34{\%}; BF longer range of activity; GM increase in peak amplitude of 44{\%}). These changes in EMG patterns during 20{\%} UC were successfully counteracted by the use of ASP and it was interesting to observe that the use of ASP during 20{\%} UC was perceived positively by all cyclists regarding both comfort and performance. These results could have a practical relevance in terms of improving performance during UC, together with reducing discomfort. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Context: Rowing is one of the original modern Olympic sports and was one of the most popular spectator sports in the United States. Its popularity has been increasing since the enactment of Title IX. The injury patterns in this sport are unique because of the stress applied during the rowing stroke. Evidence Acquisition: This review summarizes the existing literature describing the biomechanics of the rowing stroke and rowing-related injury patterns. Data were obtained from previously published peer-reviewed literature through a search of the entire PubMed database (up to December, 2011) as well as from textbook chapters and rowing coaching manuals. Results: Rowing injuries are primarily overuse related. The knee, lumbar spine, and ribs are most commonly affected. The injury incidence is directly related to the volume of training and technique. Conclusion: Familiarity of the injury patterns and the biomechanical forces affecting the rowing athlete will aid in prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

@article{Bernard2009,
abstract = {PURPOSE:: The aim of this study was to evaluate the power output (PO) during the cycle phase of the Beijing World Cup test event of the Olympic triathlon in China 2008. METHODS:: Ten elite triathletes (5 females, 5 males) performed two laboratory tests: an incremental cycling test during which PO, HR at ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2), and maximal aerobic power (MAP) were assessed, and a brief all-out test to determine maximal anaerobic power output (MAnP). During the cycle part of competition, PO and HR were measured directly with portable device. The amount of time spent below PO at VT1 (zone 1), between PO at VT1 and VT2 (zone 2), between PO at VT2 and MAP (zone 3) and above MAP (zone 4) was analyzed. RESULTS:: A significant decrease in PO, speed, and HR values was observed during the race. The distribution of time was 51 ± 9{\%} for zone 1, 17 ± 6{\%} for zone 2, 15 ± 3{\%} for zone 3, and 17 ± 6{\%} was performed at workloads higher than MAP (zone 4). From HR values, the triathletes spent 27 ± 12{\%} in zone 1, 26 ± 8{\%} in zone 2, and 48 ± 14{\%} above VT2. CONCLUSIONS:: This study indicates a progressive reduction in speed, PO, and HR, coupled with an increase in variability during the event. The Olympic distance triathlon requires a higher aerobic and anaerobic involvement than constant-workload cycling exercises classically analyzed in laboratory settings (i.e., time trial) or Ironman triathlons. Furthermore, monitoring direct PO could be more suitable to quantify the intensity of a race with pacing strategies than classic HR measurements.},

abstract = {The flow motions in the turbulent boundary layer between water and a rowing boat initiate a turbulent skin friction. Reducing this skin friction results in better rowing performances. A Taylor-Couette (TC) facility was used to verify the power losses due to velocity fluctuations PV′ in relation to the total power, as a function of the velocity amplitude A. It was demonstrated that an increase of the velocity fluctuations results in a tremendous decrease of the velocity efficiency eV. The velocity efficiency eV for a typical rowing velocity amplitude A of 20-25{\%} was about 0.92-0.95{\%}. Suppressing boat velocity fluctuations with 60{\%} will increase boat speed with 1.6{\%}. Riblet surfaces were applied on the inner and outer cylinder wall to indicate the drag reducing ability of such surfaces. The results of the measurements at constant velocity are identical as the results reported earlier, while the experimental configuration was different. This confirms once more the consistency of the TC-system for drag studies. The maximum drag reduction DR was 3.4{\%} at a Reynolds number Res 4.7 × 104, which corresponds to a shear velocity in this TC-system with water of V 4.7 m/s. For typical rowing velocity fluctuations, the riblets maintain to reduce the drag with 2.8{\%} and corresponds to a averaged velocity increase of 0.9{\%}. The drag reducing ability of riblets is partly lost due to velocity fluctuations with high amplitudes (A {\textgreater} 20{\%}). From these results, it is concluded that the friction coefficient Cf will vary within one cycle. Higher acceleration/deceleration leads to a additional level of turbulent kinetic energy.},

Traditionally, concurrent augmented feedback has been provided verbally or visually. However, more recent studies have shown sonification of data during the movement, i.e. the mapping of a measured variable to parameter of sound, can be very effective to learn temporal aspects of a movement or movement patterns. In this pilot study, it was investigated if learning of complex pushing-pulling action applied to clipless pedals of a cycling ergometer can be enhanced by sonification of the crank moment. Three novice and three experienced cyclists were invited to train a reference crank moment pattern for two consecutive days (a total of twelve training sessions of 60 s each). However, in contrast to the results found in studies on rowing, the applied sonification did not enhance learning compared to visual and verbal instruction only. The lack of learning might be due to an inappropriate sonification design, short training sessions or the high task complexity. Extended studies are needed to draw more significant conclusions.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the advantage of the application of speedstrips to rowing oars for a lightweight single sculler. The research method comprehended three steps: (1) the analysis of the rowing oar movement, (2) the determination of the change in drag and (3) the composition of a rowing model to establish the advantage that could be achieved. The parameters needed for the model: boat velocity, oar angle velocity and power delivered by the rower, were recorded on a real single sculler. The change in drag due to speedstrips on cylinders was determined by performing wind tunnel experiments. The rowing model (Matlab) simulates a race by using real stroke data of a world-class rower as input, while calculating the drag with the coefficients determined by the wind tunnel experiments. The output of the model is the final advantage by the application of speedstrips to rowing oars. Speedstrips induce a 0.1{\%} advantage over a 2000 m race under calm wind conditions. The advantage increases up to.4{\%} with a headwind velocity of 5 m s-1. For bigger boats, the advantage could be even more significant.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the fluid dynamic mechanisms that are fundamental to the rowing stroke. Complex interactions occur between the oar blade and water, and over the last 30 years our understanding of the mechanisms that govern rowing propulsion has developed significantly. The oar blade was once believed to rip through the water, generating a drag force acting normal to the blade. Current research indicates that the oar blade acts as an aerofoil making use of lift forces to propel the boat through the water early and late in the stroke, with drag being the dominant propulsive force when the oar is perpendicular to the boat. Early on-water research showed variations in the fluid dynamic behaviour of different oar blades. Recently, more controlled laboratory tests have isolated the oar blade from the rower-boat-water system to obtain blade characteristics. The isolated nature of recent oar blade studies and the complex nature of the oar blade-water interaction have led to suggestions that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) may be used to advance understanding of oar blade behaviour as a precursor to a more informed design process. By integrating a dynamic CFD model with a mathematical model of rowing mechanics, a full optimization of rower technique, boat rigging, and equipment design could be performed.},

abstract = {Biological and robotic grasp and manipulation are undeniably similar at the level of mechanical task performance. However, their underlying fundamental biological vs. engineering mechanisms are, by definition, dramatically different and can even be antithetical. Even our approach to each is diametrically opposite: inductive science for the study of biological systems vs. engineering synthesis for the design and construction of robotic systems. The past 20 years have seen several conceptual advances in both fields and the quest to unify them. Chief among them is the reluctant recognition that their underlying fundamental mechanisms may actually share limited common ground, while exhibiting many fundamental differences. This recognition is particularly liberating because it allows us to resolve and move beyond multiple paradoxes and contradictions that arose from the initial reasonable assumption of a large common ground. Here, we begin by introducing the perspective of neuromechanics, which emphasizes that real-world behavior emerges from the intimate interactions among the physical structure of the system, the mechanical requirements of a task, the feasible neural control actions to produce it, and the ability of the neuromuscular system to adapt through interactions with the environment. This allows us to articulate a succinct overview of a few salient conceptual paradoxes and contradictions regarding under-determined vs. over-determined mechanics, under- vs. over-actuated control, prescribed vs. emergent function, learning vs. implementation vs. adaptation, prescriptive vs. descriptive synergies, and optimal vs. habitual performance. We conclude by presenting open questions and suggesting directions for future research. We hope this frank and open-minded assessment of the state-of-the-art will encourage and guide these communities to continue to interact and make progress in these important areas at the interface of neuromechanics, neuroscience, rehabilitation and robotics.},

abstract = {A local minimum for running energetics has been reported for a specific bending stiffness, implying that shoe stiffness assists in running propulsion. However, the determinant of the metabolic optimum remains unknown. Highly stiff shoes significantly increase the moment arm of the ground reaction force (GRF) and reduce the leverage effect of joint torque at ground push-off. Inspired by previous findings, we hypothesized that the restriction of the natural metatarsophalangeal (MTP) flexion caused by stiffened shoes and the corresponding joint torque changes may reduce the benefit of shoe bending stiffness to running energetics. We proposed the critical stiffness, kcr, which is defined as the ratio of the MTP joint (MTPJ) torque to the maximal MTPJ flexion angle, as a possible threshold of the elastic benefit of shoe stiffness. 19 subjects participated in a running test while wearing insoles with five different bending stiffness levels. Joint angles, GRFs, and metabolic costs were measured and analyzed as functions of the shoe stiffness. No significant changes were found in the take-off velocity of the center of mass (CoM), but the horizontal ground push-offs were significantly reduced at different shoe stiffness levels, indicating that complementary changes in the lower-limb joint torques were introduced to maintain steady running. Slight increases in the ankle, knee, and hip joint angular impulses were observed at stiffness levels exceeding the critical stiffness, whereas the angular impulse at the MTPJ was significantly reduced. These results indicate that the shoe bending stiffness is beneficial to running energetics if it does not disturb the natural MTPJ flexion.},

abstract = {Spring-mass models have been used to characterize running mechanics and leg stiffness in a variety of conditions, yet it remains unknown how running while carrying a load affects running mechanics and leg stiffness. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that running with a load increases leg stiffness. Twenty-seven subjects ran at a constant speed on a force-measuring treadmill while carrying no load, and while wearing weight vests loaded with 10{\%}, 20{\%}, and 30{\%} of body weight. We measured lower extremity motion and created a scaled musculoskeletal model of each subject, which we used to estimate lower extremity joint angles and leg length. We estimated dimensionless leg stiffness as the ratio of the peak vertical ground reaction force (normalized to body weight) and the change in stance phase leg length (normalized to leg length at initial foot contact). Leg length was calculated as the distance from the center of the pelvis to the center-of-pressure under the foot. We found that dimensionless leg stiffness increased when running with load (p=0.001); this resulted from an increase in the peak vertical ground reaction force (p{\textless}0.001) and a smaller change in stance phase leg length (p=0.025). When running with load, subjects had longer ground contact times (p{\textless}0.020), greater hip (p{\textless}0.001) and knee flexion (p=0.048) at the time of initial foot contact, and greater peak stance phase hip, knee, and ankle flexion (p{\textless}0.05). Our results reveal that subjects run in a more crouched posture and with higher leg stiffness to accommodate an added load.},

abstract = {The speed of a competitive rowing crew depends on the number of crew members, their body mass, sex and the type of rowing-sweep rowing or sculling. The time-averaged speed is proportional to the rower's body mass to the 1/36th power, to the number of crew members to the1/9th power and to the physiological efficiency (accounted for by the rower's sex) to the 1/3rd power. The quality of the rowing shell and propulsion system is captured by one dimensionless parameter that takes the mechanical efficiency, the shape and drag coefficient of the shell and the Froude propulsion efficiency into account. We derive the biomechanical equation for the speed of rowing by two independent methods and further validate it by successfully predicting race times. We derive the theoretical upper limit of the Froude propulsion efficiency for low viscous flows. This upper limit is shown to be a function solely of the velocity ratio of blade to boat speed (i.e., it is completely independent of the blade shape), a result that may also be of interest for other repetitive propulsion systems.},

abstract = {Tilting treadmills allow a convenient study of biomechanics during uphill/downhill running, but they are not commonly available and there is even fewer tilting force-measuring treadmill. The aim of the present study was to compare uphill/downhill running on a treadmill (inclination of±8{\%}) with running on a level treadmill using additional backward or forward pulling forces to simulate the effect of gravity. This comparison specifically focused on the energy cost of running, stride frequency (SF), electromyographic activity (EMG), leg and foot angles at foot strike, and ground impact shock. The main results are that SF, impact shock, and leg and foot angle parameters determined were very similar and significantly correlated between the two methods, the intercept and slope of the linear regression not differing significantly from zero and unity, respectively. The correlation of oxygen uptake (VijO2) data between both methods was not significant during uphill running (r=0.42; P{\textgreater}0.05). VijO2 data were correlated during downhill running (r=0.74; P{\textless}0.01) but there was a significant difference between the methods (bias=-2.51±1.94mlmin-1kg-1). Linear regressions for EMG of vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius lateralis, soleus and tibialis anterior were not different from the identity line but the systematic bias was elevated for this parameter. In conclusion, this method seems appropriate for the study of SF, leg and foot angle, impact shock parameters but is less applicable for physiological variables (EMG and energy cost) during uphill/downhill running when using a tilting force-measuring treadmill is not possible. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use a quaternion rotation matrix in combination with an integration approach to transform translatory accelerations of the centre of mass (CoM) from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) during walking, from the object system onto the global frame. Second, this paper utilises double integration to determine the relative change in position of the CoM from the vertical acceleration data. Five participants were tested in which an IMU, consisting of accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers was attached on the lower spine estimated centre of mass. Participants were asked to walk three times through a calibrated volume at their self-selected walking speed. Synchronized data were collected by an IMU and an optical motion capture system (OMCS); both measured at 100 Hz. Accelerations of the IMU were transposed onto the global frame using a quaternion rotation matrix. Translatory acceleration, speed and relative change in position from the IMU were compared with the derived data from the OMCS. Peak acceleration in vertical axis showed no significant difference (p≥0.05). Difference between peak and trough speed showed significant difference (p{\textless}0.05) but relative peak-trough position between the IMU and OMCS did not show any significant difference (p≥0.05). These results indicate that quaternions, in combination with Simpsons rule integration, can be used in transforming translatory acceleration from the object frame to the global frame and therefore obtain relative change in position, thus offering a solution for using accelerometers in accurate global frame kinematic gait analyses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {It was hypothesized that a crew's rowing performance was predictable based on their total propulsive power, synchrony (a real-time comparison of rower propulsive force magnitudes) and total drag contribution (a measure of the rowers' effect on shell drag forces during the recovery), quantities calculated from individual rower's force-time profiles and recovery kinematics. A rowing pair was equipped with transducers to gather shell velocity, propulsive blade force, oar angular position and seat displacement. Eight subjects (four port, four starboard) participated in two rounds of data collection. The first round pairings were random, while the second round pairings were assigned based on Round 1 results. Regression analysis and ANCOVA were used to test the validity of assumptions inherent in the predictive model and, if applicable, explore a linear model predicting rowing performance based on total propulsive power, synchrony and total drag contribution. Total propulsive power, synchrony and total drag contribution were correlated and further were affected by pairing, violating assumptions inherent in the linear model. The original hypothesis was not supported based on these violations. Important findings include (1) performance cannot be predicted using the simple linear model proposed, (2) rowers' force-time profiles are repeatable between trials, with some but not all rowers adapting their force-time profile dependent on their pair partner, presumably in an effort to increase the level of synchrony between the two, and (3) subtle biomechanical factors may play a critical role in performance. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aerodynamics is a critical factor in the performance of cyclists, with drag being the dominant resistive force at racing speeds. Many cycling events involve athletes riding in close proximity. Previous studies have shown that flow interactions result in significant drag reductions for tandem cyclists, inline parallel to the flow [1-5]. However, the flow mechanisms associated with these changes have not been well characterised to date. This paper reports the results of wake surveys of an athlete in single and tandem formations in the Monash Wind Tunnel. Flow measurements were phase averaged over segments of the crank cycle to investigate the dynamic evolution of the wake of a pedalling cyclist. Results show that the dominant hip vortices previously identified in the wake of a single cyclist remain dominant in the trailing cyclist wake, with minimal reduction in vorticity. Wake profiles indicate the large drag saving experienced by a trailing cyclist are not due to disruption of the wake vortices or significant streamwise momentum recovery.},

Five elite, five junior and five non-rowers participated, and the biomechanics of rowing on an ergometer was analyzed at stroke rates of 20, 26 and 34. str/min. The results show that elite rowers use a similar, consistent rowing technique at all stroke rates, the technique of junior rowers follows similar principles, while the technique of non-rowers varies. Elite rowers' stroke length, handle motion and body posture do not change with stroke rate while the ratio of stroke phases, maximum forces, stroke work and joint loadings are constant at the same stroke rate but dependent on stroke rate. Junior rowers with stroke rate change also the stroke length. In non-rowers the differences can be observed in the handle motion and body posture during the stroke, their stroke length changes with stroke rate while the ratio of stroke phases stays constant. Although different movement execution is evident and variable with stroke rate, non-rowers demonstrate a consistent pattern at the same stroke rate. On the basis of the results, the crucial parameters that differentiate elite, junior, and non-rowers are identified. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Our physical model is largely based upon the model proposed by Alexander [Alexander, F. H. (1925). The theory of rowing. In Proceedings of the University of Durham Philosophical Society (pp. 160-179).]. The model's primary features include: one dimensional momentum balance, a point mass rower, infinitely stiff oars with inertia and non-infinitesimal stroke angles, and quadratic relationships between force and velocity for the boat and oar blade. Using an inverse dynamics approach, we are able to construct reasonable fits to force and kinematic data of real rowing. We show that the model is able to reasonably well predict boat velocity even when we do not fit for it. A sensitivity analysis shows that the quality of fit is more sensitive to the boat and oar drag coefficients than to other physical parameters. Allowing oar slip (CD {\textless} ∞) proves to be a necessary model ingredient but, for example, allowing for oar flexibility does not improve the quality of fit. The model seems to have the key terms and a minimum of superfluous terms for investigations of rowing. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Herein we present a polymyxin B therapeutic window based on target area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values and an adaptive feedback control algorithm (algorithm) which allows for the personalization of polymyxin B dosing. The upper bound of this therapeutic window was determined through a pharmacometric meta-analysis of polymyxin B nephrotoxicity data, and the lower bound was derived from murine thigh infection pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. A previously developed polymyxin B population pharmacokinetic model was used as the backbone for the algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm using different sparse PK sampling strategies. The results of the nephrotoxicity meta-analysis showed that nephrotoxicity rate was significantly correlated with polymyxin B exposure. Based on this analysis and previously reported murine PK/PD studies, the target AUC0–24 (AUC from 0 to 24 h) window was determined to be 50 to 100 mg {\textperiodcentered} h/liter. MCS showed that with standard polymyxin B dosing without adaptive feedback control, only 71{\%} of simulated subjects achieved AUC values within this window. Using a single PK sample collected at 24 h and the algorithm, personalized dosing regimens could be computed, which resulted in 95{\%} of simulated subjects achieving AUC0–24 values within the target window. Target attainment further increased when more samples were used. Our algorithm increases the probability of target attainment by using as few as one pharmacokinetic sample and enables precise, personalized dosing in a vulnerable patient population.},

abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index ($\eta$2, $\omega$2 and $\epsilon$2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of $\eta$2 in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies. Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options.},

In particular, two ensuing concepts are treated, namely (i) the energetic equivalent of blood lactate accumulation in blood, whence the notions of lactic power and lactic capacity, and (ii) the energy sources allowing contraction of the oxygen deficit at the onset of square-wave exercise.

abstract = {Electrical stimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry is believed to provide therapeutic benefits for some spinal cord injured (SCI) paraplegics and quadriplegics. However, to date these benefits have been marginal. To improve the design and increase the effectiveness of these systems it is necessary to have a better understanding of the factors that influence the force production capabilities of the stimulated muscles, the ability of the muscles to produce the desired movement, and the metabolic demands of the contractions. A dynamic musculoskeletal model capable of simulating a SCI person exercising on a stimulation-powered leg cycle ergometer was developed to explore these issues. We then used the model to address the question: Can performance be improved by changing seat configuration, the loading, or the intermuscle stimulation pattern? Performance was assessed in terms of 1) the probability that a given SCI subject would be able to maintain a steady cadence, 2) the relative strength required by each muscle group to pedal alone, and 3) the estimated rate of metabolic energy utilization associated with steady-state pedaling. We also considered the sensitivity of the model predictions to intersubject variability. Several strategies are suggested for either minimizing the strength needed to pedal, or maximizing the cardiovascular aerobic exercise. {\textcopyright} 1993 IEEE},

abstract = {When humans hop in place or run forward, they adjust leg stiffness to accommodate changes in stride frequency or surface stiffness. The goal of the present study was to determine the mechanisms by which humans adjust leg stiffness during hopping in place. Five subjects hopped in place at 2.2 Hz while we collected force platform and kinematic data. Each subject completed trials in which they hopped to whatever height they chose ('preferred height hopping') and trials in which they hopped as high as possible ('maximum height hopping'). Leg stiffness was approximately twice as great for maximum height hopping as for preferred height hopping. Ankle torsional stiffness was 1.9-times greater while knee torsional stiffness was 1.7-times greater in maximum height hopping than in preferred height hopping. We used a computer simulation to examine the sensitivity of leg stiffness to the observed changes in ankle and knee stiffness. Our model consisted of four segments (foot, shank, thigh, head-arms-trunk) interconnected by three torsional springs (ankle, knee, hip). In the model, increasing ankle stiffness by 1.9- fold, as observed in the subjects, caused leg stiffness to increase by 2.0- fold. Increasing knee stiffness by 1.7-fold had virtually no effect on leg stiffness. Thus, we conclude that the primary mechanism for leg stiffness adjustment is the adjustment of ankle stiffness.},

abstract = {We aimed to examine the reliability and validity of the peak power output test on a rowing ergometer (Concept II Model D Inc.) and to establish the "optimal resistance" at which this peak power output was observed in 87 participants with varying levels of physical activity and rowing expertise: 15 male and 12 female physically inactive students (age: 21 +/- 2 years), 16 male and 20 female physically active students (age: 23 +/- 2 years), and 15 male and 9 female trained rowers (age: 19 +/- 2 years). The participants performed countermovement jump (CMJ) test on a force plate, followed by 3 maximal-effort rowing trials using the lowest, medium, and the highest adjustable resistance settings (i.e., "1", "5," and "10" on the resistance control dial on the ergometer) in randomized order. The test proved to be reliable (coefficients of variation: 2.6-6.5{\%}; intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.87-0.98). The correlation coefficients between CMJ peak power and rowing peak power (both in watts per kilogram) were fairly consistent across all 3 groups of participants and resistance levels, ranging between r = 0.70 and r = 0.78. Finally, the highest power output was observed at the highest resistance setting in 2 nonathletic groups (p {\textless} 0.01), whereas rowers seem to produce the highest power output at the moderate-resistance setting. We conclude that the power output test on a Concept II rowing ergometer may serve as a reliable and valid tool for assessing whole-body peak power output in untrained individuals and rowing athletes.},

abstract = {At a constant power output, cyclists prefer to use a higher cadence than those that minimize metabolic cost. The neuromuscular mechanism underpinning the preferred higher cadence remains unclear. Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cadence on joint level work and vastus lateralis (VL) fascicle mechanics while cycling at a constant, submaximal, power output. We hypothesized that preferred cycling cadence would enhance the power capacity of the VL muscle when compared with a more economical cadence. Furthermore, we predicted that the most economical cadence would coincide with minimal total electromyographic activity from the leg muscles. Methods: Metabolic cost, lower-limb kinematics, joint level work, VL fascicle mechanics, and muscle activation of the VL, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, and soleus muscles were measured during cycling at a constant power output of 2.5 W{\textperiodcentered}kg -1 and cadences of 40, 60, 80, and 100 rpm. A preferred condition was also performed where cadence feedback was hidden from the participant. Results: Metabolic cost was lowest at 60 rpm, but the mean preferred cadence was 81 rpm. The distribution of joint work remained constant across cadences, with the majority of positive work being performed at the knee. The preferred cadence coincided with the highest VL power capacity, without a significant penalty to efficiency, based on fascicle shortening velocity. Conclusions: Cycling at a higher cadence is preferred to ensure that the muscle's ability to produce positive power remains high. Further investigations are required to examine what feedback mechanism could be responsible for the optimization of this motor pattern.},

abstract = {Purpose This study investigated how muscle coordination is adjusted in response to a decrease in the force-generating capacity of one muscle group during a sprint cycling task. Methods Fifteen participants were tested during a sprint before and after a fatigue electromyostimulation protocol was conducted on the quadriceps of one leg. Motor coordination was assessed by measuring myoelectrical activity, pedal force, and joint power. Results The decrease in force-generating capacity of the quadriceps (-28.0{\%} ± 6.8{\%}) resulted in a decrease in positive knee extension power during the pedaling task (-34.4 ± 30.6 W; P = 0.001). The activity of the main nonfatigued synergist and antagonist muscles (triceps surae, gluteus maximus and hamstrings) of the ipsilateral leg decreased, leading to a decrease in joint power at the hip (-30.1 ± 37.8 W; P = 0.008) and ankle (-20.8 ± 18.7 W; P = 0.001). However, both the net power around the knee and the ability to effectively orientate the pedal force were maintained during the extension by reducing the coactivation and the associated negative power produced by the hamstrings. Adaptations also occurred in flexion phases in both legs, exhibiting an increased power (+17.9 ± 28.3 [P = 0.004] and +19.5 ± 21.9 W [P = 0.026]), associated with an improvement in mechanical effectiveness. Conclusion These results demonstrate that the nervous system readily adapts coordination in response to peripheral fatigue by (i) decreasing the activation of adjacent nonfatigued muscles to maintain an effective pedal force orientation (despite reducing pedal power) and (ii) increasing the neural drive to muscles involved in the flexion phases such that the decrease in total pedal power is limited.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of foot-strike technique on longitudinal arch mechanics and intrinsic foot muscle function during running. Methods: Thirteen healthy participants ran barefoot on a force-instrumented treadmill at 2.8 msj1 with a forefoot (FFS) and rearfoot (RFS; habitual) running technique, whereas kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic data from the intrinsic foot muscles were collected simultaneously. The longitudinal arch was modeled as a single ''midfoot'' joint representing motion of the rearfoot (calcaneus) relative to the forefoot (metatarsals). An inverse dynamic analysis was performed to estimate joint moments generated about the midfoot, as well as mechanical work and power. Results: The midfoot was more plantar flexed (higher arch) at foot contact when running with a forefoot running technique (RFS 0.2o T 1.8o vs FFS 6.9o T 3.0-, effect size (ES) = 2.7); however, there was no difference in peak midfoot dorsiflexion in stance (RFS j11.6o T 3.0o vs FFS j11.4o T 3.4-, ES = 0.63). When running with a forefoot technique, participants generated greater moments about the midfoot (27{\%} increase, ES = 1.1) and performed more negative work (240{\%} increase, ES = 2.2) and positive work (42{\%} increase, ES = 1.1) about the midfoot. Average stance-phase muscle activation was greater for flexor digitorum brevis (20{\%} increase, ES = 0.56) and abductor hallucis (17{\%} increase, ES = 0.63) when running with a forefoot technique. Conclusions: Forefoot running increases loading about the longitudinal arch and also increases the mechanical work performed by the intrinsic foot muscles. These findings have substantial implications in terms of injury prevention andmanagement for runnerswho transition froma rearfoot to a forefoot running technique.},

abstract = {We have developed a musculoskeletal model of the human lower extremity for computer simulation studies of musculotendon function and muscle coordination during movement. This model incorporates the salient features of muscle and tendon, specifies the musculoskeletal geometry and musculotendon parameters of 18 musculotendon actuators, and defines the active isometric moment of these actuators about the hip, knee, and ankle joints in the sagittal plane. We found that tendon slack length, optimal muscle-fiber length, and moment arm are different for each actuator, thus each actuator develops peak isometric moment at a different joint angle. The joint angle where an actuator produces peak moment does not necessarily coincide with the joint angle where: (1) muscle force peaks, (2) moment arm peaks, or (3) the in vivo moment developed by maximum voluntary contractions peaks. We conclude that when tendon is neglected in analyses of musculotendon force or moment about joints, erroneous predictions of human musculotendon function may be stated, not only in static situations as studied here, but during movement as well. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {We formulated a "one-size-fits-all" model that predicts the energy requirements of level human walking from height, weight, and walking speed. Our three-component model theorizes that the energy expended per kilogram per stride is independent of stature at mechanically equivalent walking speeds. We measured steady-state rates of oxygen uptake of 78 subjects who spanned a nearly twofold range of statures (1.07-2.11 m) and sevenfold range of body masses (16-112 kg) at treadmill speeds from 0.4 to 1.9 m/s. We tested the size independence of the model by deriving best-fit equations in the form of the model on four stature groups (n ≥ 15): short, moderately short, moderately tall, and tall. The mean walking metabolic rates predicted by these four independently derived equations for the same set of reference subjects (n = 16; stature range: 1.30 -1.90 m) agreed with one another to within an average of 5.2 ± 3.7{\%} at the four intermediate speeds in our protocol. We next evaluated the model's gross predictive accuracy by dividing our 78 subjects into 39 stature-matched pairs of experimental and validation group subjects. The model best-fit equation derived on the experimental group subjects predicted the walking metabolic rates of the validation group subjects to within an average of 8.1 ± 6.7{\%} (R2 = 0.90; standard error of estimate = 1.34 ml O2{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1). The predictive error of the American College of Sports Medicine equation (18.0 ± 13.1{\%}), which does not include stature as a predictor, was more than twice as large for the same subject group. We conclude that the energy cost of level human walking can be accurately predicted from height, weight, and walking speed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {We propose a methodology for evaluation of agreement between two methods of measuring a continuous variable whose variability changes with magnitude. This problem routinely arises in method comparison studies that are common in health-related disciplines. Assuming replicated measurements, we first model the data using a heteroscedastic mixed-effects model, wherein a suitably defined true measurement serves as the variance covariate. Fitting this model poses some computational difficulties as the likelihood function is not available in a closed form. We deal with this issue by suggesting four estimation methods to obtain approximate maximum likelihood estimates. Two of these methods are based on numerical approximation of the likelihood, and the other two are based on approximation of the model. Next, we extend the existing agreement evaluation methodology designed for homoscedastic data to work under the proposed heteroscedastic model. This methodology can be used with any scalar measure of agreement. Simulations show that the suggested inference procedures generally work well for moderately large samples. They are illustrated by analyzing a data set of cholesterol measurements. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

In this study, we would investigate the effects of saddle place (saddle position and saddle height) on the behavior of muscles and joints. Moreover, we would try to reveal the relationship between the muscles activity (Act) and the joints reaction forces (F) and saddle position and saddle height. To this end, the pedaling conditions are obtained from the biomechanical model of the human movement system presented in AnyBody software. The variations in 12 muscles Act and total, normal and shear F of ankle, knee and hip joints are studied for the various saddle places in the pedaling feasible range. The relationships of those muscles Act and joints F are predicted by the response surface method. The results indicate that the muscles and the joints behavior changes for various saddle position and saddle height. The maximum and the minimum of the total response are acquired in the ankle and hip joints, respectively. In contrast to the ankle and hip joints, the knee shear response is greater than the normal response. The predictive models of the muscles Act and the joints F (the regression coefficients (R 2 ) are 0.60–0.95 and 0.76–0.97, respectively) indicate their nonlinear behavior with saddle position and saddle height variations. Studying the muscles and joints behavior in different pedaling condition can be helpful for the suitable saddle placement in order for rehabilitation, muscles soreness reduction, and joints disorder treatment.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel orientation algorithm designed to support a computationally efficient, wearable inertial human motion tracking system for rehabilitation applications. It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; {\textless} 0.8° static RMS error, {\textless} 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {At least nine different equations have been published for calculating metabolic expenditure by indirect calorimetry. This study examined the differences between equations when they are used for the nutritional assessment in an intensive care unit (ICU). Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured in 36 ICU patients and used to calculate metabolic expenditure with the nine equations. The equations produced differences in metabolic expenditure which averaged from 0.8-96 kcal/day. The largest difference produced by any two of the nine equations was 189 kcal/day. Although differences in original stoichiometric data have resulted in numerous different equations for the calculation of metabolic expenditure, these differences are not clinically important. It makes little difference which equation is used for nutritional assessment in an ICU. {\textcopyright} 1988, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

@article{Muscle1938,
abstract = {The hope was recently expressed (Hill I937, p. 116) that with the development of a more accurate and rapid technique for muscle heat measurement, a much more consistent picture might emerge of the energy relations of muscles shortening (or lengthening) and doing positive (or negative) work. This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called "visco-elasticity" of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the "visco-elastic" properties of active muscle are shown to be a con- sequence of the properties described in Part II.},

abstract = {Sportscience 10, 12-45 (sportsci.org/2006/ssrowing.htm) Boat velocity has increased linearly by 2-3{\%} per decade since the first Oxford-Cambridge boat race in 1829. Part of this increase is a result of recruitment of athletes from a population that has become taller and stronger. However, the increase in boat speed attributable to increased physical dimensions alone accounts for less than 10{\%} of the total improvement, because the increase in rower mass has increased boat drag. A 10-fold increase in training load over the last 150 years probably accounts for about one-third of the increase in physical capacity and performance. The rest of the improvement is due to reductions in boat drag, increases in oar blade efficiency, and improvements in rowing technique. Boat design was revolutionized in the 19th century, the only substantial change since then being a gradual reduction in boat weight. Oar design and construction have evolved steadily, the most recent development being the introduction of cleaver or " big " blades in 1991. Improvements in rowing technique have increased boat speed by reducing boat yaw, pitch and roll, and by improving the pattern of force application. New tools for real-time measurement and feedback of boat kinematics and force patterns are opening new approaches to training of individual rowers and to selection of rowers for team boats.

Inspired by Alejandro Lucia's tutorial lecture on the science of the Tour de France at the 2005 ACSM meeting, I proposed and was accepted to present a tutorial lecture titled 150 years of scientific enquiry into rowing and rowers for the 2006 meeting. In developing the lecture, I soon realized that there were too many isolated research topics and too many possible detours. So, I decided to focus on one central question: what can science tell us about the improvements in rowing performance over time and how they have happened? I have modified the presentation from the original lecture format, removing a video clip and adding some explanatory notes in green text on some of the slides. The PDF contains the slides in a printer-friendly format.},

abstract = {The muscles that power vertebrate locomotion are associated with springy tissues, both within muscle and in connective tissue elements such as tendons. These springs share in common the same simple action: they stretch and store elastic strain energy when force is applied to them and recoil to release energy when force decays. Although this elastic action is simple, it serves a diverse set of functions, including metabolic energy conservation, amplification of muscle power output, attenuation of muscle power input, and rapid mechanical feedback that may aid in stability. In recent years, our understanding of the mechanisms and importance of biological springs in locomotion has advanced significantly, and it has been demonstrated that elastic mechanisms are essential for the effective function of the muscle motors that power movement. Here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of elastic mechanisms, with an emphasis on two proposed organizing principles. First, we review the evidence that the various functions of biological springs allow the locomotor system to operate beyond the bounds of intrinsic muscle properties, including metabolic and mechanical characteristics, as well as motor control processes. Second, we propose that an energy-based framework is useful for interpreting the diverse functions of series-elastic springs. In this framework, the direction and timing of the flow of energy between the body, the elastic element and the contracting muscle determine the function served by the elastic mechanism (e.g. energy conservation vs power amplification). We also review recent work demonstrating that structures such as tendons remodel more actively and behave more dynamically than previously assumed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

Normalwalking involves starting, stopping and changing speeds, in addition to roughlysteady locomotion.Here,wemeasure themetabolic energy cost ofwalking when changing speed. Subjects (healthy adults) walked with oscillating speeds on a constant-speed treadmill, alternating between walking slower and faster than the treadmill belt, moving back and forth in the laboratory frame. The metabolic rate for oscillating-speed walking was significantly higher than that for constant-speed walking (6-20{\%} cost increase for +0.13-0.27 m s21 speed fluctuations). The metabolic rate increase was correlated with two models: Amodel based on kinetic energy fluctuations and an inverted pendulum walkingmodel, optimized for oscillating-speed constraints. The cost of changing speeds may have behavioural implications: We predicted that the energy-optimal walking speed is lower for shorter distances. We measured preferred human walking speeds for different walking distances and found people preferred lower walking speeds for shorter distances as predicted. Further, analysing published daily walking-bout distributions, we estimate that the cost of changing speeds is 4-8{\%} of daily walking energy budget.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Maximal cycling exercise has been widely used to describe the power-velocity characteristics of lower-limb extensor muscles. This study investigated the contribution of each functional sector (i.e., extension, flexion, and transitions sectors) on the total force produced over a complete pedaling cycle. We also examined the ratio of effective force to the total pedal force, termed index of mechanical effectiveness (IE), in explaining differences in power between subjects. METHODS: Two-dimensional pedal forces and crank angles were measured during a cycling force-velocity test performed by 14 active men. Mean values of forces, power output, and IE over four functional angular sectors were assessed: top = 330°-30°, downstroke = 30°-150°, bottom = 150°-210°, and upstroke = 210°-330°. RESULTS: Linear and quadratic force-velocity and power-velocity relationships were obtained for downstroke and upstroke. Maximal power output (Pmax) generated over these two sectors represented, respectively, 73.6{\%} ± 2.6{\%} and 10.3{\%} ± 1.8{\%} of Pmax assessed over the entire cycle. In the whole group, Pmax over the complete cycle was significantly related to Pmax during the downstroke and upstroke. IE significantly decreased with pedaling rate, especially in bottom and upstroke. There were significant relationships between power output and IE for top and upstroke when the pedaling rate was below or around the optimal value and in all the sectors at very high cadences. CONCLUSIONS: Although data from force-velocity test primarily characterize the muscular function involved in the downstroke phase, they also reflect the flexor muscles' ability to actively pull on the pedal during the upstroke. IE influences the power output in the upstroke phase and near the top dead center, and IE accounts for differences in power between subjects at high pedaling rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Objective The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) elicited by median nerve stimulation consists of the N20 peak together with the concurrent high frequency oscillation (HFO, {\textgreater} 500 Hz). We describe the conditions for HFO detection in ECoG and scalp EEG in intraoperative recordings. Methods During neurosurgical interventions in six patients under propofol anesthesia, the SEP was recorded from subdural electrode strips (15 recordings) and from scalp electrodes (10/15 recordings). We quantified the spatial attenuation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of N20 and HFO along the contacts of the electrode strip. We then compared the SNR of ECoG and simultaneous scalp EEG in a biophysical framework. Results HFO detection under propofol anesthesia was demonstrated. Visual inspection of strip cortical recordings revealed phase reversal for N20 in 14/15 recordings and for HFO in 10/15 recordings. N20 had higher maximal SNR (median 33.5 dB) than HFO (median 23 dB). The SNR of N20 attenuated with a larger spatial extent (median 7.2 dB/cm) than the SNR of HFO (median 12.3 dB/cm). We found significant correlations between the maximum SNR (rho = 0.58, p = 0.025) and the spatial attenuation (rho = 0.86, p {\textless} 0.001) of N20 and HFO. In 3/10 recordings we found HFO in scalp EEG. Based on the spatial attenuation and SNR in the ECoG, we estimated the scalp EEG amplitude ratio N20/HFO and found significant correlation with recorded values (rho = 0.65, p = 0.049). Conclusions We proved possible the intraoperative SEP HFO detection under propofol anesthesia. The spatial attenuation along ECoG contacts represents a good estimator of the area contributing to scalp EEG. The SNR and the spatial attenuation in ECoG recordings provide further insights for the prediction of HFO detectability in scalp EEG. The results obtained in this context may not be limited to SEP HFO, but could be generalized to biological signatures lying in the same SNR and frequency range.},

abstract = {Background: Genital numbness and erectile dysfunction in cyclists may result from repeated perineal impacts on the bicycle saddle (micro-trauma) that occur during routine cycling. Aim: To evaluate the relationship between oscillation forces and perineal pressures among cyclists in a simulated laboratory setting. Methods: Participants were fit to a study bicycle to ensure all cyclists had the same torso angle (60 ± 1 degree) and maximum knee angle (150 ± 1 degree). A lever system was used to generate oscillation events of 3 progressively increasing magnitudes. Perineal pressure was continuously measured using a pressure sensor on the bicycle saddle. This process was carried out in each of the following conditions: (1) stationary (not pedaling) with the standard seatpost, (2) pedaling with standard seatpost, (3) stationary with seatpost shock absorber, and (4) pedaling with seatpost shock absorber. Outcomes: We compared perineal pressure changes during oscillation events in the stationary and pedaling states, with and without the seatpost shock absorber. Results: A total of 39 individuals were recruited (29 men and 10 women). As the amount of oscillation increased from an average of 0.7g (acceleration due to Earth's gravity) to 1.3g, the perineal pressure increased from 10.3{\%} over baseline to 19.4{\%} over baseline. There was a strong linear relationship between the amount of oscillation and increase in pressure (r2 = 0.8, P {\textless}.001). A seatpost shock absorber decreased the impact of oscillation by 53{\%} in the stationary condition. Men and women absorbed the majority of shock in areas corresponding to pelvic bony landmarks. Conclusion: This study represents one of the first characterizations of cycling-associated perineal micro-trauma in a laboratory setting. We found a strong linear relationship between oscillation magnitude and perineal pressure during cycling, which was mitigated by a seatpost shock absorber. The use of shock absorption in bicycle design may reduce perineal micro-trauma and potentially improve cycling-associated perineal numbness and erectile dysfunction.

abstract = {A computer model of the human lower extremity was developed to study how surgical lengthening of tendon affects the force- and moment-generating capacity of the muscles. This model computes the maximum isometric force and the resulting joint moments that each muscle-tendon complex can develop at any body position. Tendon lengthenings were simulated by increasing the tendon length of each muscle-tendon complex and computing the change in the maximum isometric muscle force and joint moments at a specific body position. These simulations showed that the forces and moments developed by the ankle plantarflexors are extremely sensitive to changes in tendon length. For example, at a body position corresponding to the midstance phase of gait, the maximum isometric moment generated by soleus decreased 30{\%} with a 1-cm increase in tendon length, and 85{\%} with a 2-cm increases in tendon length. In contrast, 1- and 2-cm increases in iliopsoas tendon length decreased its hip flexion moment by only 4{\%} and 9{\%}, respectively. This article quantifies the sensitivity of muscle force and joint moments to changes in tendon length for the most commonly lengthened lower-extremity tendons. These results indicate how much each of these tendons should be lengthened to achieve an incremental decrease in muscle force or joint moment.},

abstract = {Walking and running, the two basic gaits used by man, are very complex movements. They can, however, be described using two simple models: an inverted pendulum and a spring. Muscles must contract at each step to move the body segments in the proper sequence but the work done is, in part, relieved by the interplay of mechanical energies, potential and kinetic in walking, and elastic in running. This explains why there is an optimal speed of walking (minimal metabolic cost of about 2 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}m-1 at about 1.11 m{\textperiodcentered}s-1) and why the cost of running is constant and independent of speed (about 4 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1.m-1). Historically, the mechanical work of locomotion has been divided into external and internal work. The former is the work done to raise and accelerate the body centre of mass (m) within the environment, the latter is the work done to accelerate the body segments with respect to the centre of m. The total work has been calculated, somewhat arbitrarily, as the sum of the two. While the changes of potential and kinetic energies can be accurately measured, the contribution of the elastic energy cannot easily be assessed, nor can the true work performed by the muscles. Many factors can affect the work of locomotion - the gradient of the terrain, body size (height and body m), and gravity. The partitioning of positive and negative work and their different efficiencies explain why the most economical gradient is about -10{\%} (1.1 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1.m-1 at 1.3 m{\textperiodcentered}s-1 for walking, and 3.1 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1.m-1 at between 3 and 4 m{\textperiodcentered}s-1 for running). The mechanics of walking of children, pigmies and dwarfs, in particular the recovery of energy at each step, is not different from that of taller (normal sized) individuals when the speed is expressed in dynamically equivalent terms (Froude number). An extra load, external or internal (obesity) affects internal and external work according to the distribution of the added m. Different gravitational environments determine the optimal speed of walking and the speed of transition from walking to running: at more than 1 g it is easier to walk than to run, and it is the opposite at less than 1 g. Passive aids, such as skis or skates, allow an increase in the speed of progression, but the mechanics of the locomotion cannot be simply described using the models for walking and running because step frequency, the proportion of step duration during which the foot is in contact with the ground, the position of the limbs, the force exerted on the ground and the time of its application are all different.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the computational performances of two direct methods for solving large-scale, nonlinear, optimal control problems in human movement. Direct shooting and direct collocation were implemented on an 8-segment, 48-muscle model of the body (24 muscles on each side) to compute the optimal control solution for maximum-height jumping. Both algorithms were executed on a freely-available musculoskeletal modeling platform called OpenSim. Direct collocation converged to essentially the same optimal solution up to 249 times faster than direct shooting when the same initial guess was assumed (3.4 h of CPU time for direct collocation vs. 35.3 days for direct shooting). The model predictions were in good agreement with the time histories of joint angles, ground reaction forces and muscle activation patterns measured for subjects jumping to their maximum achievable heights. Both methods converged to essentially the same solution when started from the same initial guess, but computation time was sensitive to the initial guess assumed. Direct collocation demonstrates exceptional computational performance and is well suited to performing predictive simulations of movement using large-scale musculoskeletal models.},

abstract = {The quantification of mechanical power can provide valuable insight into athlete performance because it is the mechanical principle of the rate at which the athlete does work or transfers energy to complete a movement task. Estimates of power are usually limited by the capabilities of measurement systems, resulting in the use of simplified power models. This review provides a systematic overview of the studies on mechanical power in sports, discussing the application and estimation of mechanical power, the consequences of simplifications, and the terminology. The mechanical power balance consists of five parts, where joint power is equal to the sum of kinetic power, gravitational power, environmental power, and frictional power. Structuring literature based on these power components shows that simplifications in models are done on four levels, single vs multibody models, instantaneous power (IN) versus change in energy (EN), the dimensions of a model (1D, 2D, 3D), and neglecting parts of the mechanical power balance. Quantifying the consequences of simplification of power models has only been done for running, and shows differences ranging from 10{\%} up to 250{\%} compared to joint power models. Furthermore, inconsistency and imprecision were found in the determination of joint power, resulting from inverse dynamics methods, incorporation of translational joint powers, partitioning in negative and positive work, and power flow between segments. Most inconsistency in terminology was found in the definition and application of ‘external' and ‘internal' work and power. Sport research would benefit from structuring the research on mechanical power in sports and quantifying the result of simplifications in mechanical power estimations.},

abstract = {Drag area (A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) is a primary factor determining aerodynamic resistance during level cycling and is therefore a key determinant of level time trial performance. However, A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} has traditionally been difficult to measure. Our purpose was to determine the value of adding field-measured A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} as a correlate of level cycling time trial performance. In the field, 19 male cyclists performed a level (22.1 km) time trial. Separately, field-determined A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and rolling resistance were calculated for subjects along with projected frontal area assessed directly (AP) and indirectly (Est A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}P{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Also, a graded exercise test was performed to determine VO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} peak, lactate threshold (LT), and economy. VO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} peak (l min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and power at LT were significantly correlated to power measured during the time trial (r = 0.83 and 0.69, respectively) but were not significantly correlated to performance time (r = -0.42 and-0.45). The correlation with performance time improved significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) when these variables were normalized to A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Of note, A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} alone was better correlated to performance time (r = 0.85, p {\textless} 0.001) than any combination of non-normalized physiological measure. The best correlate with performance time was field-measured power output during the time trial normalized to A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (r = -0.92). A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}P{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} only accounted for 54{\%} of the variability in A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Accordingly, the correlation to performance time was significantly lower using power normalized to A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}P{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (r = -0.75) or Est A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}P{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (r = -0.71). In conclusion, unless normalized to A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, level time trial performance in the field was not highly correlated to common laboratory measures. Furthermore, our field-measured A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is easy to determine and was the single best predictor of level time trial performance.},

abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is relatively inexpensive, does not involve ionising radiation, and requires much shorter scan times compared with other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. These advantages make it an appealing option in both clinical and research settings. Computational models of the human musculoskeletal system are used for a wide range of applications in biomechanics, from studies of muscle function during locomotion to pre-operative planning of orthopaedic surgeries. The integration of ultrasound imaging with musculoskeletal modelling has the potential to create new opportunities in the study of human movement science. Subject-specific measures of muscle–tendon properties and bone geometry obtained from ultrasound imaging are now being used in conjunction with detailed models of the musculoskeletal system to better understand muscle–tendon function during normal and pathological movement. This approach also allows more rigorous validation studies to be performed to quantify the accuracy of musculoskeletal modelling predictions. We have been using ultrasound imaging to create subject-specific models of the human musculoskeletal system for the purpose of simulating normal and pathological gait. This review describes our experiences in using ultrasound imaging to measure muscle–tendon architecture and bone geometry in vivo. Recent studies focused on integrating ultrasound imaging and musculoskeletal modelling to determine muscle–tendon function in human walking and running are also described.},

abstract = {Similarly sized bipeds and quadrupeds use nearly the same amount of metabolic energy to run, despite dramatic differences in morphology and running mechanics. It has been shown that the rate of metabolic energy use in quadrupedal runners and bipedal hoppers can be predicted from just body weight and the time available to generate force as indicated by the duration of foot-ground contact. We tested whether this link between running mechanics and energetics also applies to running bipeds. We measured rates of energy consumption and times of foot contact for humans (mean body mass 78.88 kg) and five species of birds (mean body mass range 0.13-40.1 kg). We find that most (70-90 {\%}) of the increase in metabolic rate with speed in running bipeds can be explained by changes in the time available to generate force. The rate of force generation also explains differences in metabolic rate over the size range of birds measured. However, for a given rate of force generation, birds use on average 1.7 times more metabolic energy than quadrupeds. The rate of energy consumption for a given rate of force generation for humans is intermediate between that of birds and quadrupeds. These results support the idea that the cost of muscular force production determines the energy cost of running and suggest that bipedal runners use more energy for a given rate of force production because they require a greater volume of muscle to support their body weight.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational method for solving optimal control problems involving large-scale, nonlinear, dynamical systems. Central to the approach is the idea that any optimal control problem can be converted into a standard nonlinear programming problem by parameterizing each control history using a set of nodal points, which then become the variables in the resulting parameter optimization problem. A key feature of the method is that it dispenses with the need to solve the two-point, boundary-value problem derived from the necessary conditions of optimal control theory. Gradient-based methods for solving such problems do not always converge due to computational errors introduced by the highly nonlinear characteristics of the costate variables. Instead, by converting the optimal control problem into a parameter optimization problem, any number of well-developed and proven nonlinear programming algorithms can be used to compute the near-optimal control trajectories. The utility of the parameter optimization approach for solving general optimal control problems for human movement is demonstrated by applying it to a detailed optimal control model for maximum-height human jumping. The validity of the near-optimal control solution is established by comparing it to a solution of the two-point, boundary-value problem derived on the basis of a bang-bang optimal control algorithm. Quantitative comparisons between model and experiment further show that the parameter optimization solution reproduces the major features of a maximum-height, countermovement jump (i.e., trajectories of body-segmental displacements, vertical andfore-aft ground reaction forces, displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the whole-body center of mass, pattern of lower-extremity muscular activity, jump height, and total ground contact time). {\textcopyright} 1992 by ASME.},

abstract = {During human running, softer parts of the body may deform under load and dissipate mechanical energy. Although tissues such as the heel pad have been characterized individually, the aggregate work performed by all soft tissues during running is unknown. We therefore estimated the work performed by soft tissues (N=healthy adults) at running speeds ranging 2-m s-1, computed as the difference between joint work performed on rigid segments, and whole-body estimates of work performed on the (non-rigid) body center of mass (COM) and peripheral to the COM. Soft tissues performed aggregate negative work, with magnitude increasing linearly with speed. The amount was about -19 J per stance phase at a nominal 3 m s-1, accounting for more than 25{\%} of stance phase negative work performed by the entire body. Fluctuations in soft tissue mechanical power over time resembled a damped oscillation starting at ground contact, with peak negative power comparable to that for the knee joint (about -500 W). Even the positive work from soft tissue rebound was significant, about 13 J per stance phase (about 17{\%} of the positive work of the entire body). Assuming that the net dissipative work is offset by an equal amount of active, positive muscle work performed at 25{\%} efficiency, soft tissue dissipation could account for about 29{\%} of the net metabolic expenditure for running at 5 m s-1. During running, soft tissue deformations dissipate mechanical energy that must be offset by active muscle work at non-negligible metabolic cost.},

Simulations also allow us to establish cause-and-effect relationships giving insights into muscle function. Perhaps the most exciting feature of simulations is the potential to perform "what if" studies to test hypotheses, predict functional outcomes, and identify emergent behaviors.

abstract = {Ever since the implementation of invasive EEG recordings in the clinical setting, it has been perceived that a considerable proportion of epileptic discharges present at a cortical level are missed by routine scalp EEG recordings. Several in vitro, in vivo, and simulation studies have been performed in the past decades aiming to clarify the interrelations of cortical sources with their scalp and invasive EEG correlates. The amplitude ratio of cortical potentials to their scalp EEG correlates, the extent of the cortical area involved in the discharge, as well as the localization of the cortical source and its geometry have been each independently linked to the recording of the cortical discharge with scalp electrodes. The need to elucidate these interrelations has been particularly imperative in the field of epilepsy surgery with its rapidly growing EEG-based localization technologies. Simultaneous multiscale EEG recordings with scalp, subdural and/or depth electrodes, applied in presurgical epilepsy workup, offer an excellent opportunity to shed some light to this fundamental issue. Whereas past studies have considered predominantly neocortical sources in the context of temporal lobe epilepsy, current investigations have included deep sources, as in mesial temporal epilepsy, as well as extratemporal sources. Novel computational tools may serve to provide surrogates for the shortcomings of EEG recording methodology and facilitate further developments in modern electrophysiology.},

abstract = {This work describes a generalized method for classifying motor-related neural signals for a brain-computer interface (BCI), based on a stochastic machine learning method. The method differs from the various feature extraction and selection techniques employed in many other BCI systems. The classifier does not use extensive a-priori information, resulting in reduced reliance on highly specific domain knowledge. Instead of pre-defining features, the time-domain signal is input to a population of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in order to perform a stochastic search for the best structure. The results showed that the average performance of the new algorithm outperformed other published methods using the Berlin BCI IV (2008) competition dataset and was comparable to the best results in the Berlin BCI II (2002-3) competition dataset. The new method was also applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from five subjects undertaking a hand squeeze task and demonstrated high levels of accuracy with a mean classification accuracy of 78.9{\%} after five-fold cross-validation. Our new approach has been shown to give accurate results across different motor tasks and signal types as well as between subjects.},

abstract = {Objective. Our purpose was to evaluate the ability of a dual electrode approach to remove motion artifact from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. Approach. We used a phantom human head model and robotic motion platform to induce motion while collecting scalp EEG. We assembled a dual electrode array capturing (a) artificial neural signals plus noise from scalp EEG electrodes, and (b) electrically isolated motion artifact noise. We recorded artificial neural signals broadcast from antennae in the phantom head during continuous vertical sinusoidal movements (stationary, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00 Hz movement frequencies). We evaluated signal quality using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), cross-correlation, and root mean square error (RMSE) between the ground truth broadcast signals and the recovered EEG signals. Main results. Signal quality was restored following noise cancellation when compared to single electrode EEG measurements collected with no phantom head motion. Significance. We achieved substantial motion artifact attenuation using secondary electrodes for noise cancellation. These methods can be applied to studying electrocortical signals during human locomotion to improve real-world neuroimaging using EEG.},

Methods: A systematic review of physical activity tools to explore evidence for reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Narrative answers to "four key questions" on motion sensors, questionnaires and diaries were drafted by the core writing team and then discussed at the Exercise Working Group in ECFS Lisbon 2013. Results and summary: Our current position is that activity monitors such as SenseWear or ActiGraph offer informed choices to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of physical activity, and should as a minimum report on dimensions of physical activity including energy expenditure, step count and time spent in different intensities and sedentary time. The DigiWalker pedometer offers an informed choice of a comparatively inexpensive method of obtaining some measurement of physical activity. The HAES represents an informed choice of questionnaire to assess physical activity. There is insufficient data to recommend the use of one diary over another. Future research should focus on providing additional evidence of clinimetric properties of these and new physical activity assessment tools, as well as further exploring the added value of physical activity assessment in CF.},

abstract = {In this study the variation in ground reaction force parameters was investigated with respect to adaptations to speed and mode of progression, and to type of foot‐strike. Twelve healthy male subjects were studied during walking (1.0–3.0 m s‐1) and running (1.5–6.0 m s‐1). The subjects were selected with respect to foot‐strike pattern during running. Six subjects were classified as rearfoot strikers and six as forefoot strikers. Constant speeds were accomplished by pacer lights beside an indoor straightway and controlled by means of a photo‐electronic device. The vertical, anteroposterior and mediolateral force components were recorded with a force platform. Computer software was used to calculate durations, amplitudes and impulses of the reaction forces. The amplitudes were normalized with respect to body weight (b.w.). Increased speed was accompanied by shorter force periods and larger peak forces. The peak amplitude of the vertical reaction force in walking and running increased with speed from approximately 1.0 to 1.5 b.w. and 2.0 to 2.9 b.w. respectively. The anteroposterior peak force and mediolateral peak‐to‐peak force increased about 2 times with speed in walking and about 2–4 times in running (the absolute values were on average about 10 times smaller than the vertical). The transition from walking to running resulted in a shorter support phase duration and a change in the shape of the vertical reaction force curve. The vertical peak force increased whereas the vertical impulse and the anteroposterior impulses and peak forces decreased. In running the vertical force showed an impact peak at touch‐down among the rearfoot strikers but generally not among the forefoot strikers. The first mediolateral force peak was laterally directed (as in walking) for the rearfoot strikers but medially for the forefoot strikers. Thus, there is a change with speed in the complex interaction between vertical and horizontal forces needed for propulsion and equilibrium during human locomotion. The differences present between walking and running are consequences of fundamental differences in motor strategies between the two major forms of human progression. {\textcopyright} 1989 Scandinavian Physiological Society},

In spite of these advantages, they have not been widely adopted in human-in-The-loop control and learning applications. In this study, we propose a biologically inspired multimodal human-in-The-loop control system for driving a one degree-of-freedom robot, and realize the task of hammering a nail into a wood block under human control. We analyze the human sensorimotor learning in this system through a set of experiments, and show that effective autonomous hammering skill can be readily obtained through the developed human-robot interface. The results indicate that a human-in-The-loop learning setup with anthropomorphically valid multi-modal human-robot interface leads to fast learning, thus can be used to effectively derive autonomous robot skills for ballistic motor tasks that require modulation of impedance.},

@article{OToole1995,
abstract = {The triathlon is a 3-event endurance sport in which athletes compete sequentially in swimming, cycling and running. The primary determinant of success is the ability to sustain a high rate of energy expenditure for prolonged periods of time. Exercise training-induced physiological adaptations in virtually all systems of the body allow the athlete to accomplish this. Aerobic capacity (measured as maximal oxygen uptake, V̇O2max), economy of motion (submaximal V̇O2) and fractional utilisation of maximal capacity ({\%}V̇O2max) reflect the integrated responses of these physiological adaptations. Numerous studies have reported relatively high mean V̇O2max) values for various groups of triathletes that are comparable to those reported for athletes in single-event endurance sports and clearly above those reported for untrained individuals. In shorter distance triathlons and in studies using recreational (rather than elite) triathletes, V̇O2maxis related to performance in the corresponding event of the triathlon (e.g. tethered swimming V̇O2maxwith swim time). In longer events and with more elite triathletes, V̇O2maxCorrelates less well with performance. The physiological adaptations that correspond to and facilitate improved V̇O2maxoccur centrally in the cardiovascular system, centred on increased maximal cardiac output, and peripherally in the metabolic systems, centred around increased arterio-venous O2(a-v O2) difference. While a high V̇O2maxin individuals is clearly of importance to triathlon performance, energy output must be sustained for long periods of time, making economy of motion also very important. Studies suggests that competitive swimmers have better swimming economy than triathletes. However, since many triathletes have previously been competitive swimmers this finding is questionable. The finding suggests that triathletes from nonswimming backgrounds would benefit from improving swimming technique rather than concentrating training workouts solely on distance. In cycling and running, comparison studies have not been done. Economy of motion in swimming, cycling and running have all been found to be correlated with comparable event performance. Training to improve swimming economy can be done without prior exercise, but training to improve cycling and running economy should take the multimode nature of a triathlon into consideration. That is, swimming should precede cycling economy training, and cycling should precede running economy training. Cardiovascular, metabolic and neuromuscular adaptations are the main physiological correlates of improved movement economy. Since exercise-induced stress on most physiological systems is based on relative, rather than absolute, exercise intensity, training and racing intensities are frequently quantified as a percentage of maximal capacity or {\%}V̇O2max. Several studies of triathletes have examined the role of {\%}V̇O2maxin triathlon performance, and have found relatively high correlations for each of the triathlon events with event-specific fractional utilisations. The {\%}V̇O2maxaccessible is governed by several physiological systems, but most importantly by the lactate threshold. For the triathlete, lactate thresholds during swimming, cycling and running may all occur at different energy outputs, percentages of maximal capacity and heart rates. Lactate thresholds, therefore, must be measured independently in each of the 3 sports. In addition to V̇O2maxmovement economy and fractional utilisation of maximal capacity, considerations of energy balance, fluid and electrolyte balance as well as cardiac function over time are important for the success of the triathlete. The triathlete must maintain energy stores on a day-to-day basis during training and be able to generate energy at a high rate during the race. Likewise, fluid and electrolyte balance must be maintained daily as well as during the race. Continued and appropriate cardiovascular function is necessary for the transport of nutrients and oxygen, as well as for heat dissipation. Physiological considerations for triathlon training and racing are in many ways similar to those underlying successful performance of single-event endurance activities. However, because of the combination of skills and energy demands, the triathlon remains a unique physiological stress. Much remains to be investigated regarding the optimal physiological adaptations necessary for optimal and safe triathlon performance. {\textcopyright} 1995, Adis International Limited.

abstract = {This book provides a conceptual and computational framework to study how the nervous system exploits the anatomical properties of limbs to produce mechanical function. The study of the neural control of limbs has historically emphasized the use of optimization to find solutions to the muscle redundancy problem. That is, how does the nervous system select a specific muscle coordination pattern when the many muscles of a limb allow for multiple solutions? I revisit this problem from the emerging perspective of neuromechanics that emphasizes finding and implementing families of feasible solutions, instead of a single and unique optimal solution. Those families of feasible solutions emerge naturally from the interactions among the feasible neural commands, anatomy of the limb, and constraints of the task. Such alternative perspective to the neural control of limb function is not only biologically plausible, but sheds light on the most central tenets and debates in the fields of neural control, robotics, rehabilitation, and brain-body co-evolutionary adaptations. This perspective developed from courses I taught to engineers and life scientists at Cornell University and the University of Southern California, and is made possible by combining fundamental concepts from mechanics, anatomy, mathematics, robotics and neuroscience with advances in the field of computational geometry. Fundamentals of Neuromechanics is intended for neuroscientists, roboticists, engineers, physicians, evolutionary biologists, athletes, and physical and occupational therapists seeking to advance their understanding of neuromechanics. Therefore, the tone is decidedly pedagogical, engaging, integrative, and practical to make it accessible to people coming from a broad spectrum of disciplines. I attempt to tread the line between making the mathematical exposition accessible to life scientists, and convey the wonder and complexity of neuroscience to engineers and computational scientists. While no one approach can hope to definitively resolve the important questions in these related fields, I hope to provide you with the fundamental background and tools to allow you to contribute to the emerging field of neuromechanics.},

This complex and unique sport requires athletes to appropriately distribute their speed or energy expenditure (ie, pacing) within each discipline as well as over the entire event. As with most physical activity, the regulation of pacing in triathlon may be influenced by a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The majority of current research focuses mainly on the Olympic distance, whilst much less literature is available on other triathlon distances such as the sprint, half-Ironman, and Ironman distances. Furthermore, little is understood regarding the specific physiological, environmental, and interdisciplinary effects on pacing. Therefore, this article discusses the pacing strategies observed in triathlon across different distances, and elucidates the possible factors influencing pacing within the three specific disciplines of a triathlon.},

We show that neither effect is necessary for self-stability. Using linearized stability calculations as a guide, we built a bicycle with extra counter-rotating wheels (canceling the wheel spin angular momentum) and with its front-wheel ground-contact forward of the steer axis (making the trailing distance negative). When laterally disturbed from rolling straight, this bicycle automatically recovers to upright travel. Our results show that various design variables, like the front mass location and the steer axis tilt, contribute to stability in complex interacting ways.},

abstract = {Low back pain is the commonest musculoskeletal complaint in rowers. Research into the relationship between rowing technique, the forces generated during the rowing stroke and the kinematics of spinal motion are increasing, but to date none have investigated the impact of different rowing intensities on this relationship. A technique has been developed using an electromagnetic motion system and strain gauge instrumented load cell to measure spinal and pelvic motion and force generated at the handle during rowing on an exercise rowing ergometer. Using this technique ten collegiate male rowers (mean age 22.1 ± 2.8 years) from local rowing clubs were investigated. The test protocol consisted of rowing on an ergometer at three different stroke ratings; 17-20 strokes per minute; 24-28 strokes per minute; and 28-36 strokes per minute. Each rating was held for four minutes, with a five-minute rest between each rating. Marked changes in the force output curve and lumbopelvic kinematics were observed at the different rowing intensities. Although there was no change in the magnitude of peak torque generated during the different rating, there was a marked shift in when this occurred during the stroke. In terms of kinematic changes, these centred around changes in pelvic rotation at the catch and finish stages of the stroke with significantly less anterior rotation occurring at the catch position at higher rowing intensities. To conclude, this study suggests that rowing kinematics and force profiles do change at higher rowing intensities. These changes may be an important factor with respect to injury mechanisms, however, further work is required at an elite level.},

abstract = {Background/Objective: Current cycling pedals constrain the pedaling motion to the sagittal plane. This study aimed to evaluate novel pedal systems that allow lateral translation through the pedal stroke via frontal plane kinematics and muscle recruitment. Methods: Sixteen cyclists were recruited to pedal on three pedal systems: standard pedals (STD), free lateral translation (LAT), and a guided lateral translation pedal (VL). Frontal plane kinematics were measured via markers on the hip, knee, and foot. EMG recordings were collected from 8 leg muscles and expressed as a percentage of functional threshold power activation levels. Results: Knee and ankle range of movement was significantly more highly correlated in the VL pedals compared to STD (r =.46 ±.08, vs.23 ±.05; p =.028). The rectus femoris was recruited significantly less in the VL vs. STD pedals (23.6 ± 7.7{\%} lower, p =.008). The hip abductors were more highly recruited in VL vs. STD: gluteus medius (16.9 ± 7.2{\%} higher, p =.033) and the tensor fascia latae (30.9 ± 8.5{\%} lower, p =.003). Conclusion: VL pedals may improve knee-to-ankle tracking through the pedal stroke and may allow cyclists to increase power output through the additional recruitment of hip abductors.},

@article{Matijevich2019,
abstract = {Introduction Tibial stress fractures are a common overuse injury resulting from the accumulation of bone microdamage due to repeated loading. Researchers and wearable device developers have sought to understand or predict stress fracture risks, and other injury risks, by monitoring the ground reaction force (GRF, the force between the foot and ground), or GRF correlates (e.g., tibial shock) captured via wearable sensors. Increases in GRF metrics are typically assumed to reflect increases in loading on internal biological structures (e.g., bones). The purpose of this study was to evaluate this assumption for running by testing if increases in GRF metrics were strongly correlated with increases in tibial compression force over a range of speeds and slopes. Methods Ten healthy individuals performed running trials while we collected GRFs and kinematics. We assessed if commonly-used vertical GRF metrics (impact peak, loading rate, active peak, impulse) were strongly correlated with tibial load metrics (peak force, impulse). Results On average, increases in GRF metrics were not strongly correlated with increases in tibial load metrics. For instance, correlating GRF impact peak and loading rate with peak tibial load resulted in r = -0.29±0.37 and r = -0.20±0.35 (inter-subject mean and standard deviation), respectively. We observed high inter-subject variability in correlations, though most coefficients were negligible, weak or moderate. Seventy-six of the 80 subject-specific correlation coefficients computed indicated that higher GRF metrics were not strongly correlated with higher tibial forces. Conclusions These results demonstrate that commonly-used GRF metrics can mislead our understanding of loading on internal structures, such as the tibia. Increases in GRF metrics should not be assumed to be an indicator of increases in tibial bone load or overuse injury risk during running. This has important implications for sports, wearable devices, and research on running-related injuries, affecting {\textgreater}50 scientific publications per year from 2015–2017.},

abstract = {Although it is clear that rowers have a large muscle mass, their distribution of muscle mass and which of the main motions in rowing mediates muscle hypertrophy in each body part are unclear. We examine the relationships between partial motion power in rowing and muscle cross-sectional area of the thigh, lower back, and upper arms. Sixty young rowers (39 males and 21 females) participated in the study. Joint positions and forces were measured by video cameras and rowing ergometer software, respectively. One-dimensional motion analysis was performed to calculate the power of leg drive, trunk swing, and arm pull motions. Muscle cross-sectional areas were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple regression analyses were carried out to determine the association of different muscle cross-sectional areas with partial motion power. The anterior thigh best explained the power demonstrated by leg drive (r2=0.508), the posterior thigh and lower back combined best explained the power demonstrated by the trunk swing (r2=0.493), and the elbow extensors best explained the power demonstrated by the arm pull (r2=0.195). Other correlations, such as arm muscles with leg drive power (r2=0.424) and anterior thigh with trunk swing power (r2=0.335), were also significant. All muscle cross-sectional areas were associated with rowing performance either through the production of power or by transmitting work. The results imply that rowing motion requires a well-balanced distribution of muscle mass throughout the body.},

abstract = {As engineering systems become more complex and include major elements of software as well as hardware, the approach to design has changed. Sequential design methods are being replaced by concurrent design processes. This has been apparent for some time in engineering applications where ‘control-configured' solutions involving system integration, embedded controllers and multidisciplinary design issues are important, such as in the aircraft industry. Similar developments can also be found in other fields, such as automotive engineering and robotics. The introduction of integrated systems and the multidisciplinary processes of concurrent design have important implications for system modelling and simulation. Design processes of this kind are usually strongly model-dependent and involve optimisation at a system level. Models used as a basis for design must be of proven quality as model limitations and errors have direct implications in terms of the performance of the resulting system.},

abstract = {The popular Hill model for muscle activation and contractile dynamics has been extended with several different formulations for predicting the metabolic energy expenditure of human muscle actions. These extended models differ considerably in their approach to computing energy expenditure, particularly in their treatment of active lengthening and eccentric work, but their predictive abilities have never been compared. In this study, we compared the predictions of five different Hill-based muscle energy models in 3D forward dynamics simulations of normal human walking. In a data-tracking simulation that minimized muscle fatigue, the energy models predicted metabolic costs that varied over a three-fold range (2.45-7.15. J/m/kg), with the distinction arising from whether or not eccentric work was subtracted from the net heat rate in the calculation of the muscle metabolic rate. In predictive simulations that optimized neuromuscular control to minimize the metabolic cost, all five models predicted similar speeds, step lengths, and stance phase durations. However, some of the models predicted a hip circumduction strategy to minimize metabolic cost, while others did not, and the accuracy of the predicted knee and ankle angles and ground reaction forces also depended on the energy model used. The results highlights the need to clarify how eccentric work should be treated when calculating muscle energy expenditure, the difficulty in predicting realistic metabolic costs in simulated walking even with a detailed 3D musculoskeletal model, the potential for using such models to predict energetically-optimal gait modifications, and the room for improvement in existing muscle energy models and locomotion simulation frameworks. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and objective Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations of movement have been increasingly used in orthopedic and neurological scenarios, with increased attention to subject-specific applications. In general, musculoskeletal modeling applications have been facilitated by the development of dedicated software tools; however, subject-specific studies have been limited also by time-consuming modeling workflows and high skilled expertise required. In addition, no reference tools exist to standardize the process of musculoskeletal model creation and make it more efficient. Here we present a freely available software application, NMSBUILDER 2.0, to create musculoskeletal models in the file format of OpenSim, a widely-used open-source platform for musculoskeletal modeling and simulation. NMSBUILDER 2.0 is the result of a major refactoring of a previous implementation that moved a first step toward an efficient workflow for subject-specific model creation. Methods NMSBUILDER includes a graphical user interface that provides access to all functionalities, based on a framework for computer-aided medicine written in C++. The operations implemented can be used in a workflow to create OpenSim musculoskeletal models from 3D surfaces. A first step includes data processing to create supporting objects necessary to create models, e.g. surfaces, anatomical landmarks, reference systems; and a second step includes the creation of OpenSim objects, e.g. bodies, joints, muscles, and the corresponding model. Results We present a case study using NMSBUILDER 2.0: the creation of an MRI-based musculoskeletal model of the lower limb. The model included four rigid bodies, five degrees of freedom and 43 musculotendon actuators, and was created from 3D surfaces of the segmented images of a healthy subject through the modeling workflow implemented in the software application. Conclusions We have presented NMSBUILDER 2.0 for the creation of musculoskeletal OpenSim models from image-based data, and made it freely available via nmsbuilder.org. This application provides an efficient workflow for model creation and helps standardize the process. We hope this would help promote personalized applications in musculoskeletal biomechanics, including larger sample size studies, and might also represent a basis for future developments for specific applications.},

abstract = {From the Editors R ising energy prices in the 1970s triggered interest in using anaerobic digestion on U.S. farms to produce and use biogas from animal manures and resulted in the construction of several full-scale systems on commercial farms. Lessons learned during this developmental period (1975-1985) have resulted in improvements in design and operating parameters, equipment, and cost effectiveness. The past decade has marked a period of significant expansion in the use of commercially proven biogas production and utilization systems by the dairy and swine industry. This growth in farm sector demand is due largely to improved technology and services, favorable renewable energy policies, federal and state incentive programs, and the " neighbor friendly " environmental advantages digester technologies provide as residential development expands in rural areas and regulatory pressures increase. There are currently about 70 animal waste digesters in operation on swine and dairy farms. Included are three centralized systems that provide waste treatment services to multiple farms. An additional 40 systems are in initial development stages and are planned to be operational in the next few years. These 120 systems have the potential to provide 25 MW of grid connected base load renewable energy while reducing greenhouse gases (methane) by about 40,000 metric tons per year—equivalent to 840,000 metric tons CO 2. This handbook was developed to provide guidance for farms that are considering anaerobic digestion as a manure management option. When coupled with the use of FarmWare, the handbook is intended to provide a step by step methodology to assist users in making a preliminary technical, financial, and environmental assessment of a project's feasibility, based on farm size, current manure management practices, energy use profiles, and technology choice. The handbook has been printed as loose-leaf pages in a ring binder. This format was chosen because it facilitates updating material to keep pace with an expanding industry and technology base.},

abstract = {Muscles attach to bones via tendons that stretch and recoil, affecting muscle force generation and metabolic energy consumption. In this study, we investigated the effect of tendon compliance on the metabolic cost of running using a full-body musculoskeletal model with a detailed model of muscle energetics. We performed muscle-driven simulations of running at 2-5 m/s with tendon force-strain curves that produced between 1 and 10{\%} strain when the muscles were developing maximum isometric force. We computed the average metabolic power consumed by each muscle when running at each speed and with each tendon compliance. Average whole-body metabolic power consumption increased as running speed increased, regardless of tendon compliance, and was lowest at each speed when tendon strain reached 2-3{\%} as muscles were developing maximum isometric force. When running at 2 m/s, the soleus muscle consumed less metabolic power at high tendon compliance because the strain of the tendon allowed the muscle fibers to operate nearly isometrically during stance. In contrast, the medial and lateral gastrocnemii consumed less metabolic power at low tendon compliance because less compliant tendons allowed the muscle fibers to operate closer to their optimal lengths during stance. The software and simulations used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and enable examination of muscle energetics with unprecedented detail.},

Power outputs ranged from {\~{}}100–700 W with a pedalling frequency of 90 revolution per minute. Three-dimensional handle and pedal forces were simultaneously recorded. Using non-negative matrix factorisation, we extracted muscle synergies and we analysed the integrated EMG and EMG temporal patterns. Most of the muscles showed tonic activity that became more phasic as power output increased. Three muscle synergies were identified, associated with (i) torso stabilisation, (ii) compensation/generation of trunk accelerations and (iii) upper body weight support. Synergies were similar for seated and standing positions (Pearson's r {\textgreater} 0.7), but synergy {\#}2 (biceps brachii, deltoidus and brachioradialis) was shifted forward during the cycle ({\~{}}7{\%} of cycle). The activity levels of synergy {\#}1 (latissimus dorsi and erector spinae) and synergy {\#}2 increased markedly above {\~{}}500 W (i.e., {\~{}}+40–70{\%} and +130–190{\%}) and during periods corresponding to ipsi- and contralateral downstrokes, respectively. Our study results suggest that the upper limb and trunk muscles may play important roles in cycling when high power outputs are required.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to quantify the effect of power output on muscle coordination during rowing. Surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of 23 muscles and mechanical variables were recorded in eight untrained subjects and seven experienced rowers. Each subject was asked to perform three 2-min constant-load exercises performed at 60, 90 and 120{\%} of the mean power output over a maximal 2,000-m event (denoted as P60, P90, and P120, respectively). A decomposition algorithm (nonnegative matrix factorization) was used to extract the muscle synergies that represent the global temporal and spatial organization of the motor output. The results showed a main effect of power output for 22 of 23 muscles (p values ranged from{\textless}0.0001 to 0.004) indicating a significant increase in EMG activity level with power output for both untrained and experienced subjects. However, for the two populations, no dramatic modification in the shape of individual EMG patterns (mean r max value = 0.93 ± 0.09) or in their timing of activation (maximum lag time = -4.3 ± 3.8{\%} of the rowing cycle) was found. The results also showed a large consistency of the three extracted muscle synergies, for both synergy activation coefficients (mean rmax values range from 0.87 to 0.97) and muscle synergy vectors (mean r values range from 0.70 to 0.76) across the three power outputs. In conclusion, despite significant changes in the level of muscle activity, the global temporal and spatial organization of the motor output is very little affected by power output on a rowing ergometer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Older ('Masters') athletes strive to maintain or even improve upon the performance they achieved at younger ages, but declines in athletic performance are inevitable with ageing. In this review, we describe changes in peak endurance exercise performance with advancing age as well as physiological factors responsible for those changes. Peak endurance performance is maintained until ∼35 years of age, followed by modest decreases until 50-60 years of age, with progressively steeper declines thereafter. Among the three main physiological determinants of endurance exercise performance (i.e. maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2max), lactate threshold and exercise economy), a progressive reduction V̇O2max in appears to be the primary mechanism associated with declines in endurance performance with age. A reduction in lactate threshold, i.e. the exercise intensity at which blood lactate concentration increases significantly above baseline, also contributes to the reduction in endurance performance with ageing, although this may be secondary to decreases in V̇O2max. In contrast, exercise economy (i.e. metabolic cost of sustained submaximal exercise) does not change with age in endurance-trained adults. Decreases in maximal stroke volume, heart rate and arterio-venous O2 difference all appear to contribute to the age-related reductions V̇O2maxin in endurance-trained athletes. Declines in endurance exercise performance and its physiological determinants with ageing appear to be mediated in large part by a reduction in the intensity (velocity) and volume of the exercise that can be performed during training sessions. Given their impressive peak performance capability and physiological function capacity, Masters athletes remain a fascinating model of 'exceptionally successful ageing' and therefore are highly deserving of our continued scientific attention as physiologists. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.

abstract = {Theoretical studies on human locomotion have shown that a stable and flexible gait emerges from the dynamic interaction between the rhythmic activity of a neural system composed of a neural rhythm generator (RG) and the rhythmic movement of the musculo-skeletal system. This study further explores the mechanism of the anticipatory control of locomotion based on the emergent properties of a neural system that generates the basic pattern of gait. A model of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system to execute the task of stepping over a visible obstacle with both limbs during walking is described. The RG in the neural system was combined with a system referred to as a discrete movement generator (DM), which receives both the output of the RG and visual information regarding the .obstacle and generates discrete signals for modification of the basic gait pattern. A series of computer simulations demonstrated that an obstacle placed at an arbitrary position can be cleared by sequential modifications of gait: (1) modulating the step length when approaching the obstacle and (2) modifying the trajectory of the swing limbs while stepping over it. This result suggests that anticipatory adjustments are produced not by the unidirectional flow of the information from visual signals to motor commands but by the bi-directional circulation of information between the DM and the RG. The validity of this model is discussed in relation to motor cortical activity during anticipatory modifications in cats and the ecological psychology of visuo-motor control in humans.},

abstract = {Purpose: Exercise economy is one of the main physiological factors determining performance in endurance sports. Running economy (RE) can be improved with running-specific training, while the improvement of cycling economy (CE) with cycling-specific training is controversial. We investigated whether exercise economy reflects sport-specific skills/adaptations or is determined by overall physiological factors. Methods: We compared RE and CE in 10 runners, 9 cyclists and 9 triathletes for running at 12 km/h and cycling at 200 W. Gross rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were collected and used to calculate gross metabolic rate in watts for both running and cycling. Results: Runners had better RE than cyclists (917 ± 107 W vs. 1111 ± 159 W) (p {\textless} 0.01). Triathletes had intermediate RE values (1004 ± 98 W) not different from runners or cyclists. CE was not different (p = 0.20) between the three groups (runners: 945 ± 60 W; cyclists: 982 ± 44 W; triathletes: 979 ± 54 W). Conclusion: RE can be enhanced with running-specific training, but CE is independent of cycling-specific training.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy among a high number of current mobile cycling power meters used by elite and recreational cyclists against a first principle-based mathematical model of treadmill cycling. 54 power meters from 9 manufacturers used by 32 cyclists were calibrated. While the cyclist coasted downhill on a motorised treadmill, a back-pulling system was adjusted to counter the downhill force. The system was then loaded 3 times with 4 different masses while the cyclist pedalled to keep his position. The mean deviation (trueness) to the model and coefficient of variation (precision) were analysed. The mean deviations of the power meters were -0.9±3.2{\%} (mean±SD) with 6 power meters deviating by more than±5{\%}. The coefficients of variation of the power meters were 1.2±0.9{\%} (mean±SD), with Stages varying more than SRM (p{\textless}0.001) and PowerTap (p{\textless}0.001). In conclusion, current power meters used by elite and recreational cyclists vary considerably in their trueness; precision is generally high but differs between manufacturers. Calibrating and adjusting the trueness of every power meter against a first principle-based reference is advised for accurate measurements.},

abstract = {A beer bottle or soda can on a table, when slightly tipped and released, falls to an upright position and then rocks up to a somewhat opposite tilt. Superficially this rocking motion involves a collision when the flat circular base of the container slaps the table before rocking up to the opposite tilt. A keen eye notices that the after-slap rising tilt is not generally just diametrically opposite the initial tilt but is veered to one side or the other. Cushman and Duistermaat [Regular Chaotic Dyn. 11, 31 (2006)] recently noticed such veering when a flat disk with rolling boundary conditions is dropped nearly flat. Here, we generalize these rolling disk results to arbitrary axi-symmetric bodies and to frictionless sliding. More specifically, we study motions that almost but do not quite involve a face-down collision of the round container's bottom with the tabletop. These motions involve a sudden rapid motion of the contact point around the circular base. Surprisingly, similar to the rolling disk, the net angle of motion of this contact point is nearly independent of initial conditions. This angle of turn depends simply on the geometry and mass distribution but not on the moment of inertia about the symmetry axis. We derive simple asymptotic formulas for this "angle of turn" of the contact point and check the result with numerics and with simple experiments. For tall containers (height much bigger than radius) the angle of turn is just over $\pi$ and the sudden rolling motion superficially appears as a nearly symmetric collision leading to leaning on an almost diametrically opposite point on the bottom rim. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

Subjects performed two prolonged (45min) cycling sessions at constant intensity (75{\%} of maximal aerobic power). In a random order, participants cycled either with their preferred technique (PT) during one session or were helped by a visual force-feedback to modify their pedalling pattern during the other one (FB). Index of pedalling effectiveness was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) improved during FB (41.4±5.5{\%}); compared with PT (36.6±4.1{\%}). Prolonged cycling induced a significant reduction of maximal power output, which was greater after PT (-15±9{\%}) than after FB (-7±12{\%}). During steady-state FB, vastus lateralis muscle activity was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced, whereas biceps femoris muscles activities increased compared with PT. Gross efficiency (GE) did not significantly differ between the two sessions, except during the first 15min of exercise (FB: 19.0±1.9{\%} vs PT: 20.2±1.9{\%}). Although changes in muscular coordination pattern with feedback did not seem to influence GE, it could be mainly responsible for the reduction of muscle fatigue after prolonged cycling. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Computation of muscle excitation patterns that produce coordinated movements of muscle-actuated dynamic models is an important and challenging problem. Using dynamic optimization to compute excitation patterns comes at a large computational cost, which has limited the use of muscle-actuated simulations. This paper introduces a new algorithm, which we call computed muscle control, that uses static optimization along with feedforward and feedback controls to drive the kinematic trajectory of a musculoskeletal model toward a set of desired kinematics. We illustrate the algorithm by computing a set of muscle excitations that drive a 30-muscle, 3-degree-of-freedom model of pedaling to track measured pedaling kinematics and forces. Only 10min of computer time were required to compute muscle excitations that reproduced the measured pedaling dynamics, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than conventional dynamic optimization techniques. Simulated kinematics were within 1° of experimental values, simulated pedal forces were within one standard deviation of measured pedal forces for nearly all of the crank cycle, and computed muscle excitations were similar in timing to measured electromyographic patterns. The speed and accuracy of this new algorithm improves the feasibility of using detailed musculoskeletal models to simulate and analyze movement. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We measured kinematics and pedal forces and used inverse dynamics to calculate joint power for the hip, knee and ankle joints during an incremental cycling protocol performed by 21 recreational cyclists. Vastus lateralis mVO2was estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy with an arterial occlusion. The main finding was a non-linear relationship between vastus lateralis mVO2and external work rate that was characterised by an increase followed by a tendency for a levelling off (R2=0.99 and 0.94 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p{\textless}0.05). When comparing 100 W and 225 W, there was a {\~{}}43 W increase in knee extension but still a {\~{}}9{\%} decrease in relative contribution of knee extension to external work rate resulting from a {\~{}}47 W increase in hip extension. When vastus lateralis mVO2was related to knee extension power, the relationship was still non-linear (R2=0.99 and 0.97 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p{\textless}0.05). These results demonstrate a non-linear response in mVO2relative to a change in external work rate. Relating vastus lateralis mVO2to knee extension power showed a better fit to a linear equation compared to external work rate, but it is not a straight line.},

abstract = {Background: The loss of an arm presents a substantial challenge for upper limb amputees when performing activities of daily living. Myoelectric prosthetic devices partially replace lost hand functions; however, lack of sensory feedback and strong understanding of the myoelectric control system prevent prosthesis users from interacting with their environment effectively. Although most research in augmented sensory feedback has focused on real-time regulation, sensory feedback is also essential for enabling the development and correction of internal models, which in turn are used for planning movements and reacting to control variability faster than otherwise possible in the presence of sensory delays. Methods: Our recent work has demonstrated that audio-augmented feedback can improve both performance and internal model strength for an abstract target acquisition task. Here we use this concept in controlling a robotic hand, which has inherent dynamics and variability, and apply it to a more functional grasp-and-lift task. We assessed internal model strength using psychophysical tests and used an instrumented Virtual Egg to assess performance. Results: Results obtained from 14 able-bodied subjects show that a classifier-based controller augmented with audio feedback enabled stronger internal model (p = 0.018) and better performance (p = 0.028) than a controller without this feedback. Conclusions: We extended our previous work and accomplished the first steps on a path towards bridging the gap between research and clinical usability of a hand prosthesis. The main goal was to assess whether the ability to decouple internal model strength and motion variability using the continuous audio-augmented feedback extended to real-world use, where the inherent mechanical variability and dynamics in the mechanisms may contribute to a more complicated interplay between internal model formation and motion variability. We concluded that benefits of using audio-augmented feedback for improving internal model strength of myoelectric controllers extend beyond a virtual target acquisition task to include control of a prosthetic hand.},

abstract = {Even though human legs allow a wide repertoire of movements, when people travel by foot they mostly use one of two locomotor patterns, namely, walking and running. The selection of these two gaits from the plethora of options might be because walking and running require less metabolic energy than other more unusual gaits. We addressed this possibility previously using numerical optimization of a minimal mathematical model of a biped. We had found that, for a given step-length, the two classical descriptions of walking and running, 'inverted pendulum walking' and 'impulsive running', do indeed minimize the amount of positive work required at low and high speeds respectively. Here, for the case of small step-lengths, we establish the previous results analytically. First, we simplify the two-dimensional particle trajectory problem to a one-dimensional 'elevator' problem. Then we use elementary geometric arguments on the resulting phase plane to show optimality of the two gaits: walking at low speeds and running at high speeds. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Although people's legs are capable of a broad range of muscle-use and gait patterns, they generally prefer just two. They walk, swinging their body over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run, bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases. Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running feels easiest when going faster. More unusual gaits seem more tiring. Perhaps this is because walking and running use the least energy1-7. Addressing this classic1 conjecture with experiments2,3 requires comparing walking and running with many other strange and unpractised gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy cost by using mechanics-based models. Here we use a minimal model that can describe walking and running as well as an infinite variety of other gaits. We use computer optimization to find which gaits are indeed energetically optimal for this model. At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic inverted-pendulum walk8-13, at high speeds it discovers a bouncing run12,13, even without springs, and at intermediate speeds it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes walking and running as extreme cases. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Background: The development of muscular power is often a key focus of sports performance enhancement programs. Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the effect of load on peak power during the squat, jump squat, power clean, and hang power clean, thus integrating the findings of various studies to provide the strength and conditioning professional with more reliable evidence upon which to base their program design. Methods: A search of electronic databases [MEDLINE (SPORTDiscus), PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science] was conducted to identify all publications up to 30 June 2014. Hedges' g (95 {\%} confidence interval) was estimated using a weighted random-effect model. A total of 27 studies with 468 subjects and 5766 effect sizes met the inclusion criterion and were included in the statistical analyses. Load in each study was labeled as one of three intensity zones: Zone 1 represented an average intensity ranging from 0 to 30 {\%} of one repetition maximum (1RM); Zone 2 between 30 and 70 {\%} of 1RM; and Zone 3 ≥70 {\%} of 1RM. Results: These results showed different optimal loads for each exercise examined. Moderate loads (from {\textgreater}30 to {\textless}70 {\%} of 1RM) appear to provide the optimal load for power production in the squat exercise. Lighter loads (≤30 {\%} of 1RM) showed the highest peak power production in the jump squat. Heavier loads (≥70 {\%} of 1RM) resulted in greater peak power production in the power clean and hang power clean. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis of results from the published literature provides evidence for exercise-specific optimal loads for power production.},

abstract = {Accurate measures of performance are important for assessing competitive athletes in practical and research settings. We present here a review of rowing performance measures, focusing on the errors in these measures and the implications for testing rowers. The yardstick for assessing error in a performance measure is the random variation (typical or standard error of measurement) in an elite athletes competitive performance from race to race: ∼1.0 for time in 2000m rowing events. There has been little research interest in on-water time trials for assessing rowing performance, owing to logistic difficulties and environmental perturbations in performance time with such tests. Mobile ergometry via instrumented oars or rowlocks should reduce these problems, but the associated errors have not yet been reported. Measurement of boat speed to monitor on-water training performance is common; one device based on global positioning system (GPS) technology contributes negligible extra random error (0.2) in speed measured over 2000m, but extra error is substantial (110) with other GPS devices or with an impeller, especially over shorter distances. The problems with on-water testing have led to widespread use of the Concept II rowing ergometer. The standard error of the estimate of on-water 2000m time predicted by 2000m ergometer performance was 2.6 and 7.2 in two studies, reflecting different effects of skill, body mass and environment in on-water versus ergometer performance. However, well trained rowers have a typical error in performance time of only ∼0.5 between repeated 2000m time trials on this ergometer, so such trials are suitable for tracking changes in physiological performance and factors affecting it. Many researchers have used the 2000m ergometer performance time as a criterion to identify other predictors of rowing performance. Standard errors of the estimate vary widely between studies even for the same predictor, but the lowest errors (∼12) have been observed for peak power output in an incremental test, some measures of lactate threshold and measures of 30-second all-out power. Some of these measures also have typical error between repeated tests suitably low for tracking changes. Combining measures via multiple linear regression needs further investigation. In summary, measurement of boat speed, especially with a good GPS device, has adequate precision for monitoring training performance, but adjustment for environmental effects needs to be investigated. Time trials on the Concept II ergometer provide accurate estimates of a rowers physiological ability to output power, and some submaximal and brief maximal ergometer performance measures can be used frequently to monitor changes in this ability. On-water performance measured via instrumented skiffs that determine individual power output may eventually surpass measures derived from the Concept II. {\textcopyright} 2012 Adis Data Information BV.

abstract = {Mechanical power output is a key performance-determining variable in many cyclic sports. In rowing, instantaneous power output is commonly determined as the dot product of handle force moment and oar angular velocity. The aim of this study was to show that this commonly used proxy is theoretically flawed and to provide an indication of the magnitude of the error. To obtain a consistent dataset, simulations were performed using a previously proposed forward dynamical model. Inputs were previously recorded rower kinematics and horizontal oar angle, at 20 and 32 strokes∙min−1. From simulation outputs, true power output and power output according to the common proxy were calculated. The error when using the common proxy was quantified as the difference between the average power output according to the proxy and the true average power output (P̅residual), and as the ratio of this difference to the true average power output (ratiores./rower). At stroke rate 20, P̅residual was 27.4 W and ratiores./rower was 0.143; at stroke rate 32, P̅residual was 44.3 W and ratiores./rower was 0.142. Power output in rowing appears to be underestimated when calculated according to the common proxy. Simulations suggest this error to be at least 10{\%} of the true power output.},

abstract = {In-vivo hip joint contact forces (HJCF) can be estimated using computational neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) modelling. However, different neural solutions can result in different HJCF estimations. NMS model predictions are also influenced by the selection of neuromuscular parameters, which are either based on cadaveric data or calibrated to the individual. To date, the best combination of neural solution and parameter calibration to obtain plausible estimations of HJCF have not been identified. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of three electromyography (EMG)-informed neural solution modes (EMG-driven, EMG-hybrid, and EMG-assisted) and static optimisation, each using three different parameter calibrations (uncalibrated, minimise joint moments error, and minimise joint moments error and peak HJCF), on the estimation of HJCF in a healthy population (n = 23) during walking. When compared to existing in-vivo data, the EMG-assisted mode and static optimisation produced the most physiologically plausible HJCF when using a NMS model calibrated to minimise joint moments error and peak HJCF. EMG-assisted mode produced first and second peaks of 3.55 times body weight (BW) and 3.97 BW during walking; static optimisation produced 3.75 BW and 4.19 BW, respectively. However, compared to static optimisation, EMG-assisted mode generated muscle excitations closer to recorded EMG signals (average across hip muscles R2 = 0.60 ± 0.37 versus R2 = 0.12 ± 0.14). Findings suggest that the EMG-assisted mode combined with minimise joint moments error and peak HJCF calibration is preferable for the estimation of HJCF and generation of realistic load distribution across muscles.},

abstract = {In competitive rowing, the fluctuations in boat velocity during the rowing cycle are associated with an increased water resistance of the boat as compared with a boat moving at a constant velocity. We aimed to quantify the influence of the increased water resistance on race time using a mathematical approximation, based on the increase in physiological power being proportional to the 2nd power of boat speed. Biomechanical data (oar force, rowing angle, boat velocity, and boat acceleration) were measured when eight elite coxless pair crews performed a rowing test with a stepwise increasing stroke rate (SR: 20, 24, 28, and 32 min-1) that successively increased the mean boat speed. The results revealed a +4.59 s (SR 24.2) to +5.05 s (SR 31.5) 2000-m race-time difference compared with a boat hypothetically moving without velocity fluctuations. Velocity fluctuations were highly correlated with SR (r=0.93) because the accelerations of the rowers' body mass and the mass of the counteracting boat increase with SR. The possibilities to reduce velocity fluctuations and therefore race time are limited. For elite rowers, race time may be slightly reduced by a moderate reduction in SR that is compensated by an increased force output for each stroke. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

abstract = {The aims of the present study were both to describe anthropometrics and cycling power-velocity characteristics in top-level track sprinters, and to test the hypothesis that these variables would represent interesting predictors of the 200 m track sprint cycling performance. Twelve elite cyclists volunteered to perform a torque-velocity test on a calibrated cycle ergometer, after the measurement of their lean leg volume (LLV) and frontal surface area (A p), in order to draw torque- and power-velocity relationships, and to evaluate the maximal power (Pmax), and both the optimal pedalling rate (fopt) and torque (Topt) at which Pmax is reached. The 200 m performances - i.e. velocity (V200) and pedalling rate (f200) - were measured during international events (REC) and in the 2002 French Track Cycling Championships (NAT). Pmax, f opt, and Topt were respectively 1600 ± 116 W, 129.8 ± 4.7 rpm and 118.5 ± 9.8 N {\textperiodcentered} m. Pmax was strongly correlated with Topt (p {\textless} 0.001), which was correlated with LLV (p {\textless} 0.01). V200 was related to Pmax normalized by Ap (p ≤ 0.05) and also to fopt (p {\textless} 0.01) for REC and NAT. f200 (155.2 ± 3, REC; 149 ± 4.3, NAT) were significantly higher than fopt (p {\textless} 0.001). These findings demonstrated that, in this population of world-class track cyclists, the optimization of the ratio between Pmax and Ap represents a key factor of 200 m performance. Concerning the major role also played by fopt, it is assumed that, considering high values of f 200, sprinters with a high value of optimal pedalling rate (i.e. lower f200-fopt difference) could be theoretically in better conditions to maximize their power output during the race and hence performance. {\textcopyright} Georg Thieme Verlag KG.},

abstract = {Human brain mapping relies heavily on fMRI, ECoG and EEG, which capture different physiological signals. Relationships between these signals have been established in the context of specific tasks or during resting state, often using spatially confined concurrent recordings in animals. But it is not certain whether these correlations generalize to other contexts relevant for human cognitive neuroscience. Here, we address the case of complex naturalistic stimuli and ask two basic questions. First, how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods, and second, how similar are stimulus-related responses across methods? To this end, we investigated a wide range of brain regions and frequency bands. We presented the same movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects (NEEG = 45, NfMRI = 11, NECoG = 5) and assessed stimulus-driven correlations across viewings and between imaging methods, thereby ruling out task-irrelevant confounds. All three imaging methods had similar repeat-reliability across viewings when fMRI and EEG data were averaged across subjects, highlighting the potential to achieve large signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging large sample sizes. The fMRI signal correlated positively with high-frequency ECoG power across multiple task-related cortical structures but positively with low-frequency EEG and ECoG power. In contrast to previous studies, these correlations were as strong for low-frequency as for high frequency ECoG. We also observed links between fMRI and infra-slow EEG voltage fluctuations. These results extend previous findings to the case of natural stimulus processin},

Thirteen resistance-trained males performed hang power clean (HPC), jump shrug (JS), and hang high pull (HHP) repetitions at relative loads of 30{\%}, 45{\%}, 65{\%}, and 80{\%} of their one repetition maximum (1RM) HPC. Relative peak power (PPRel), work (WRel), and P-t curves were compared. The JS produced greater PPRel than the HPC (p {\textless} 0.001, d = 2.53) and the HHP (p {\textless} 0.001, d = 2.14). In addition, the HHP PPRel was statistically greater than the HPC (p = 0.008, d = 0.80). Similarly, the JS produced greater WRel compared to the HPC (p {\textless} 0.001, d = 1.89) and HHP (p {\textless} 0.001, d = 1.42). Furthermore, HHP WRel was statistically greater than the HPC (p = 0.003, d = 0.73). The P-t profiles of each exercise were similar during the first 80-85{\%} of the movement; however, during the final 15-20{\%} of the movement the P-t profile of the JS was found to be greater than the HPC and HHP. The JS produced greater PPRel and WRel compared to the HPC and HHP with large effect size differences. The HHP produced greater PPRel and WRel than the HPC with moderate effect size differences. The JS and HHP produced markedly different P-t profiles in the final 15-20{\%} of the movement compared to the HPC. Thus, these exercises may be superior methods of training to enhance PPRel. The greatest differences in PPRel between the JS and HHP and the HPC occurred at lighter loads, suggesting that loads of 30-45{\%} 1RM HPC may provide the best training stimulus when using the JS and HHP. In contrast, loads ranging 65-80{\%} 1RM HPC may provide an optimal stimulus for power production during the HPC.},

abstract = {Purpose The persistence of phase-related information in EMG signals can be quantified by its entropic half-life (EnHL). It has been proposed that the EnHL would increase with the demands of a movement task, and thus increase as the pedaling power increased during cycling. However, simulation work on the properties of EMG signals suggests that the EnHL depends on burst duration and duty cycle in the EMG that may not be related to task demands. This study aimed to distinguish between these alternate hypotheses. Methods The EnHL was characterized for 10 muscles from nine cyclists cycling at a range of powers (35 to 260 W) and cadences (60-140 rpm) for the raw EMG, phase-randomized surrogate EMG, EMG intensity, and the principal components describing the muscle coordination patterns. Results There was phase-related information in the raw EMG signals and EMG intensities that was related to the EMG burst duration, duty cycle pedaling cadence, and power. The EnHL for the EMG intensities of the individual muscles (excluding quadriceps) and for the coordination patterns decreased as cycling power and cadence increased. Conclusions The EnHL provide information on the structure of the motor control signals and their constituent motor unit action potentials, both within and between muscles, rather than on the mechanical demands of the cycling task per se.},

abstract = {Elite oarsmen and oarswomen possess large body dimensions and show outstadning aerobic and anaerobic qualities. Oarsmen have V̇O2maxvalues of 6.1 ± 0.6 L/min and have incurred O2debts of between 10 and 20 litres. The caloric expenditure of rowing estimated from the O2cost of a 6-minute rowing ergometer exercise was calculated at 36 kcal/min, one of the highest energy costs so far reported for any predominantly aerobic-type sport. Aerobic and anaerobic calculations show that 70 to 75{\%} of the energy necessary to row the standard 2000m distance for men is derived from aerobiosis while the remaining 25 to 30{\%} is anaerobic. Women achieve V̇O2maxvalues of 4.1 ± 0.4 L/min and slightly lower anaerobic values than men. The relative 60 to 65{\%} energy contribution of aerobic metabolism and 35 to 40{\%} for anaerobiosis is not surprising since women compete at 1000m. Rowers also exhibit excellent isokinetic leg strength and power when compared with other elite athletes and oarswomen produced higher relative leg strength values than men when lean body mass is considered. Muscle fibre type distributions in oarsmen resemble those of distance runners while women tend to have a slightly higher proportion of fast-twitch fibres. An average power output of 390 ± 13.6W was produced by oarsmen for 6 minutes of simulated rowing while women were able to develop 300 ± 18.4 for 3 minutes of the same activity. Mechanical efficiency for rowing was calculated at 20 ± 0.9{\%}. Oarsmen also achieve very high ventilation volumes being able to average above 200 L/min BTPS for 6 minutes of simulated rowing; women ventilate 170 L/min BTPS for 3 minutes of this exercise. Excellent V̇O2maxand O2pulse values demonstrate outstanding cardiorespiratory efficiency. Both oarsmen and oarswomen utilise a unique physiological pattern of race pacing; they begin exertion with a vigorous sprint which places excessive demands on anaerobic metabolism followed by a severely high aerobic steady-state and then an exhaustive sprint at the finish. Tolerance to excessive anaerobiosis is evident by very high lactates and O2deficits measured during the first 2 minutes of exercise. Physiological profiles of successful international calibre rowing athletes have been established as a result of studies described in this review and the data have been used in a variety of ways to improve rowing performance. {\textcopyright} 1984, ADIS Press Limited.

abstract = {Walking humans spontaneously select different speed, frequency and step length combinations, depending on which of these three parameters is specified. This behavior can be explained by constrained optimization of cost of transport (metabolic cost/distance) where cost of transport is seen as the main component of an underlying objective function that is minimized within the limitations of specified constraints. It is then of interest to ask whether or not such results are specific to walking only, or indicate a more general feature of locomotion control. The current study examines running gait selection within the framework of constrained optimization by comparing self-selected running gaits to the gaits predicted by constrained optimization of a cost surface constructed from cost data available in the literature. Normalizing speed and frequency values in the behavioral data by preferred speed and frequency reduced inter-subject variability and made group behavioral trends more visible. Although actual behavior did not coincide exactly with running cost optimization, self-selected gait and predictions from the general human cost surface did agree to within the 95{\%} confidence interval and the region of minimal cost+0.005 ml O2 kg-1 m-1. This was similar to the level of agreement between actual and predicted behavior observed in walking. Thus, there seems to be substantial evidence to suggest that (i) selection of gait parameters in running can largely be predicted using constrained optimization, and (ii) general cost surfaces can be constructed using metabolic data from one group that will largely predict the behavior of other groups.},

abstract = {We sought to understand how leg muscle function determines the metabolic cost of walking. We first indirectly assessed the metabolic cost of swinging the legs and then examined the cost of generating muscular force during the stance phase. Four men and four women walked at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s carrying loads equal to 0, 10, 20, and 30{\%} body mass positioned symmetrically about the waist. The net metabolic rate increased in nearly direct proportion to the external mechanical power during moderate-speed (0.5-1.5 m/s) load carrying, suggesting that the cost of swinging the legs is relatively small. The active muscle volume required to generate force on the ground and the rate of generating this force accounted for {\textgreater}85{\%} of the increase in net metabolic rate across moderate speeds and most loading conditions. Although these factors explained less of the increase in metabolic rate between 1.5 and 2.0 m/s (∼50{\%}), the cost of generating force per unit volume of active muscle [i.e., the cost coefficient (k)] was similar across all conditions [k = 0.11 ± 0.03 (SD) J/cm3]. These data indicate that, regardless of the work muscles do, the metabolic cost of walking can be largely explained by the cost of generating muscular force during the stance phase.},

abstract = {1. Sexually dimorphic traits often reflect factors limiting the reproductive success of animals. Thus, most sexually dimorphic traits can be directly linked to the reproductive role of each sex. Sexual dimorphism in trophic structures (e.g. beak, jaws, teeth), however, often lacks a direct link to reproduction. 2. Trophic structures can be linked indirectly to reproductive allocation via energy acquisition. The reproductive role hypothesis (also known as the dimorphic niche hypothesis) posits such an indirect link, but has received heretofore little direct empirical support. We tested this hypothesis in a molluscivorous turtle exhibiting marked female-biased trophic morphology dimorphism. 3. Bite force analysis showed that females have stronger jaws than males and dietary analysis revealed that females ingest snails closer to their maximum biting capacity than males. Body condition of both sexes and reproductive output of females increased with relative head width, indicating that fitness is tightly linked to head size and bite force. 4. Our study provides strong evidence that reproductive role contributes to sexual dimorphism in trophic morphology. Our findings should apply to any animal in which energy intake is limited by trophic morphology.},

abstract = {Traditional laboratory experiments, rehabilitation clinics, and wearable sensors offer biomechanists a wealth of data on healthy and pathological movement. To harness the power of these data and make research more efficient, modern machine learning techniques are starting to complement traditional statistical tools. This survey summarizes the current usage of machine learning methods in human movement biomechanics and highlights best practices that will enable critical evaluation of the literature. We carried out a PubMed/Medline database search for original research articles that used machine learning to study movement biomechanics in patients with musculoskeletal and neuromuscular diseases. Most studies that met our inclusion criteria focused on classifying pathological movement, predicting risk of developing a disease, estimating the effect of an intervention, or automatically recognizing activities to facilitate out-of-clinic patient monitoring. We found that research studies build and evaluate models inconsistently, which motivated our discussion of best practices. We provide recommendations for training and evaluating machine learning models and discuss the potential of several underutilized approaches, such as deep learning, to generate new knowledge about human movement. We believe that cross-training biomechanists in data science and a cultural shift toward sharing of data and tools are essential to maximize the impact of biomechanics research.},

abstract = {Elite oarsmen and oarswomen possess large body dimensions and show outstadning aerobic and anaerobic qualities. Oarsmen have V̇O2maxvalues of 6.1 ± 0.6 L/min and have incurred O2debts of between 10 and 20 litres. The caloric expenditure of rowing estimated from the O2cost of a 6-minute rowing ergometer exercise was calculated at 36 kcal/min, one of the highest energy costs so far reported for any predominantly aerobic-type sport. Aerobic and anaerobic calculations show that 70 to 75{\%} of the energy necessary to row the standard 2000m distance for men is derived from aerobiosis while the remaining 25 to 30{\%} is anaerobic. Women achieve V̇O2maxvalues of 4.1 ± 0.4 L/min and slightly lower anaerobic values than men. The relative 60 to 65{\%} energy contribution of aerobic metabolism and 35 to 40{\%} for anaerobiosis is not surprising since women compete at 1000m. Rowers also exhibit excellent isokinetic leg strength and power when compared with other elite athletes and oarswomen produced higher relative leg strength values than men when lean body mass is considered. Muscle fibre type distributions in oarsmen resemble those of distance runners while women tend to have a slightly higher proportion of fast-twitch fibres. An average power output of 390 ± 13.6W was produced by oarsmen for 6 minutes of simulated rowing while women were able to develop 300 ± 18.4 for 3 minutes of the same activity. Mechanical efficiency for rowing was calculated at 20 ± 0.9{\%}. Oarsmen also achieve very high ventilation volumes being able to average above 200 L/min BTPS for 6 minutes of simulated rowing; women ventilate 170 L/min BTPS for 3 minutes of this exercise. Excellent V̇O2maxand O2pulse values demonstrate outstanding cardiorespiratory efficiency. Both oarsmen and oarswomen utilise a unique physiological pattern of race pacing; they begin exertion with a vigorous sprint which places excessive demands on anaerobic metabolism followed by a severely high aerobic steady-state and then an exhaustive sprint at the finish. Tolerance to excessive anaerobiosis is evident by very high lactates and O2deficits measured during the first 2 minutes of exercise. Physiological profiles of successful international calibre rowing athletes have been established as a result of studies described in this review and the data have been used in a variety of ways to improve rowing performance. {\textcopyright} 1984, ADIS Press Limited.

abstract = {When mammals run, the overall musculoskeletal system behaves as a single linear 'leg spring.' We used force platform and kinematic measurements to determine whether leg spring stiffness (k(leg)) is adjusted to accommodate changes in surface stiffness (k(surf)) when humans hop in place, a good experimental model for examining adjustments to k(leg) in bouncing gaits. We found that k(leg) was greatly increased to accommodate surfaces of lower stiffnesses. The series combination of k(leg) and k(surf) [total stiffness (k(tot)] was independent of k(surf) at a given hopping frequency. For example, when humans hopped at a frequency of 2 Hz, they tripled their k(leg) on the least stiff surface (k(surf) = 26.1 kN/m; k(leg) = 53.3 kN/m) compared with the most stiff surface (k(surf) 35,000 kN/m; k(leg) = 17.8 kN/m). Values for k(tot) were not significantly different on the least stiff surface (16.7 kN/m) and the most stiff surface (17.8 kN/m). Because of the k(leg) adjustment, many aspects of the hopping mechanics (e.g., ground-contact time and center of mass vertical displacement) remained remarkably similar despite a {\textgreater}1,000-fold change in k(surf). This study provides insight into how k(leg) adjustments can allow similar locomotion mechanics on the variety of terrains encountered by runners in the natural world.},

abstract = {We developed a pneumatically powered orthosis for the human ankle joint. The orthosis consisted of a carbon fiber shell, hinge joint, and two artificial pneumatic muscles. One artificial pneumatic muscle provided plantar flexion torque and the second one provided dorsiflexion torque. Computer software adjusted air pressure in each artificial muscle independently so that artificial muscle force was proportional to rectified low-pass-filtered electromyography (EMG) amplitude (i.e., proportional myoelectric control). Tibialis anterior EMG activated the artificial dorsiflexor and soleus EMG activated the artificial plantar flexor. We collected joint kinematic and artificial muscle force data as one healthy participant walked on a treadmill with the orthosis. Peak plantar flexor torque provided by the orthosis was 70 Nm, and peak dorsiflexor torque provided by the orthosis was 38 Nm. The orthosis could be useful for basic science studies on human locomotion or possibly for gait rehabilitation after neurological injury. {\textcopyright} 2005 Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.},

abstract = {A running animal coordinates the actions of many muscles, tendons, and ligaments in its leg so that the overall leg behaves like a single mechanical spring during ground contact. Experimental observations have revealed that an animal's leg stiffness is independent of both speed and gravity level, suggesting that it is dictated by inherent musculoskeletal properties. However, if leg stiffness was invariant, the biomechanics of running (e.g. peak ground reaction force and ground contact time) would change when an animal encountered different surfaces in the natural world. We found that human runners adjust their leg stiffness to accommodate changes in surface stiffness, allowing them to maintain similar running mechanics on different surfaces. These results provide important insight into the mechanics and control of animal locomotion and suggest that incorporating an adjustable leg stiffness in the design of hopping and running robots is important if they are to match the agility and speed of animals on varied terrain.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that an irreducibly simple, uncontrolled, two-dimensional, two-link model, vaguely resembling human legs, can walk down a shallow slope, powered only by gravity. This model is the simplest special case of the passive-dynamic models pioneered by McGeer (1990a). It has two rigid mass less legs hinged at the hip, a point-mass at the hip, and infinitesimal point-masses at the feet. The feet have plastic (no-slip, no-bounce) collisions with the slope surface, except during forward swinging, when geometric interference (foot scuffing) is ignored. After nondimensionalizing the governing equations, the model has only one free parameter, the ramp slope ʳ. This model shows stable walking modes similar to more elaborate models, but allows some use of analytic methods to study its dynamics. The analytic calculations find initial conditions and stability estimates for period-one gait limit cycles. The model exhibits two period-one gait cycles, one of which is stable when 0 {\textless} ʳ {\textless} 0.015 rad. With increasing ʳ, stable cycles of higher periods appear, and the walking-like motions apparently become chaotic through a sequence of period doublings. Scaling laws for the model predict that walking speed is proportional to stance angle, stance angle is proportional to ʳ1/3 and that the gravitational power used is proportional to v4 where v is the velocity along the slope. {\textcopyright} 1998 by ASME.},

We hypothesized that: (1) old adults would exhibit smaller peak ankle joint kinetics and larger peak hip joint kinetics than young adults during both level and uphill walking and (2) these age-related differences in ankle and hip joint kinetics would be greatest during uphill vs. level walking. We quantified the sagittal plane ankle, knee, and hip joint kinetics of 10 old adults (mean ± SD, age: 72 ± 5. yrs) and 8 young adults (age: 27 ± 5. yrs) walking at 1.25. m/s on a dual-belt, force-measuring treadmill at four grades (0°, +3°, +6°, +9°). As hypothesized, old adults walked with smaller peak ankle joint kinetics (e.g., power generation: -18{\%} at +9°) and larger peak hip joint kinetics (e.g., power generation: +119{\%} at +9°) than young adults, most evident during the late stance phase of both level and uphill conditions. Old adults performed two to three times more single support positive work than young adults via muscles crossing the knee. In partial support of our second hypothesis, the age-related reduction in peak ankle joint moments was greater during uphill (-0.41. Nm/kg) vs. level (-0.30. Nm/kg) walking. However, old adults that exhibited reduced propulsive ankle function during level walking could perform 44{\%} more trailing leg positive ankle joint work to walk uphill. Our findings indicate that maintaining ankle power generation and trailing leg propulsive function should be the primary focus of "prehabilitation" strategies for old adults to preserve their uphill walking ability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Purpose: Based on mass alone, one might intuit that running barefoot would exact a lower metabolic cost than running in shoes. Numerous studies have shown that adding mass to shoes increases submaximal oxygen uptake (V̇O 2) by approximately 1{\%} per 100 g per shoe. However, only two of the seven studies on the topic have found a statistically significant difference in V̇O2 between barefoot and shod running. The lack of difference found in these studies suggests that factors other than shoe mass (e.g., barefoot running experience, foot strike pattern, shoe construction) may play important roles in determining the metabolic cost of barefoot versus shod running. Our goal was to quantify the metabolic effects of adding mass to the feet and compare oxygen uptake and metabolic power during barefoot versus shod running while controlling for barefoot running experience, foot strike pattern, and footwear. Methods: Twelve males with substantial barefoot running experience ran at 3.35 m•s with a midfoot strike pattern on a motorized treadmill, both barefoot and in lightweight cushioned shoes (∼150 g per shoe). In additional trials, we attached small lead strips to each foot/shoe (∼150, ∼300, and ∼450 g). For each condition, we measured the subjects' rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and calculated metabolic power. Results: V̇O2 increased by approximately 1{\%} for each 100 g added per foot, whether barefoot or shod (P {\textless} 0.001). However, barefoot and shod running did not significantly differ in V̇O2 or metabolic power. A consequence of these two findings was that for footwear conditions of equal mass, shod running had ∼3{\%}-4{\%} lower V̇O2 and metabolic power demand than barefoot running (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: Running barefoot offers no metabolic advantage over running in lightweight, cushioned shoes. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.},

For example, smaller age-related declines in cycling performance than in running and swimming have been documented. The relative stability of gender differences observed across the ages suggests that the age-related declines in physiological function did not differ between males and females. Among the main physiological determinants of endurance performance, the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) appears to be the parameter that is most altered by age. Exercise economy and the exercise intensity at which a high fraction of VO2max can be sustained (i.e., lactate threshold), seem to decline to a lesser extent with advancing age. The ability to maintain a high exercise-training stimulus with advancing age is emerging as the single most important means of limiting the rate of decline in endurance performance. By constantly extending the limits of (ultra)-endurance, master athletes therefore represent an important insight into the ability of humans to maintain physical performance and physiological function with advancing age.},

abstract = {The economy of running has traditionally been quantified from the mass-specific oxygen uptake; however, because fuel substrate usage varies with exercise intensity, it is more accurate to express running economy in units of metabolic energy. Fundamentally, the understanding of the major factors that influence the energy cost of running (Erun) can be obtained with this approach. Erun is determined by the energy needed for skeletal muscle contraction. Here, we approach the study of Erun from that perspective. The amount of energy needed for skeletal muscle contraction is dependent on the force, duration, shortening, shortening velocity, and length of the muscle. These factors therefore dictate the energy cost of running. It is understood that some determinants of the energy cost of running are not trainable: environmental factors, surface characteristics, and certain anthropometric features. Other factors affecting Erun are altered by training: other anthropometric features, muscle and tendon properties, and running mechanics. Here, the key features that dictate the energy cost during distance running are reviewed in the context of skeletal muscle energetics.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was (i) to determine the age of peak triathlon performance for world class athletes competing in Olympic, Half-Ironman and Ironman distance races and (ii) to investigate a potential change in the age of the annual fastest athletes across years. Data of ages and race times of all finishers in the international top races over the three distances between 2003 and 2013 were collected and the annual top ten women and men were analysed using linear, non-linear and hierarchical multivariate regression analyses. The age of peak male performance was 27.1 ± 4.9 years in the Olympic, 28.0 ± 3.8 years in the Half-Ironman and 35.1 ± 3.6 years in the Ironman distance and the age of peak male performance was higher in the Ironman compared to the Olympic (p {\textless} 0.05) and the Half-Ironman distance (p {\textless} 0.05) triathlon. The age of peak female performance was 26.6 ± 4.4 years in the Olympic, 31.6 ± 3.4 years in the Half-Ironman and 34.4 ± 4.4 years in the Ironman distance and the age of peak female performance was lower in the Olympic compared to the Half-Ironman (p {\textless} 0.05) and Ironman distance (p {\textless} 0.05) triathlon. The age of the annual top ten women and men remained unchanged over the last decade in the Half-Ironman and the Ironman distance. In the Olympic distance, however, the age of the annual top ten men decreased slightly. To summarize, the age of peak triathlon performance was higher in the longer triathlon race distances (i.e. Ironman) and the age of the annual top triathletes remained mainly stable over the last decade. With these findings top athletes competing at world class level can plan their career more precisely as they are able to determine the right time in life to switch from the shorter (i.e. Olympic distance) to the longer triathlon race distances (i.e. Half-Ironman and Ironman) in order to continuously compete in triathlon races at world class level.},

abstract = {There are over 10 million amputees in the world, including in Colombia. Amputation below the knee, or transtibial amputation, is extremely common. Due to the physiological changes that affect transtibial amputees, the biomechanics of their gait is altered and may significantly affect their mobility. To determine the dynamic behavior of transtibial amputees and generate knowledge about their biomechanical behavior to facilitate their physical rehabilitation, it was proposed to study prosthetic gait using simulations generated by a computational model. A model of human gait was constructed using Lagrangian analysis to describe the interchange of energy that characterizes this set of movements. In addition, a mathematical model (block diagram) of an active transtibial prostheses was obtained through 3D design using Solidworks{\textregistered} software. This model was analyzed in Matlab{\textregistered} to simulate the use of the prosthesis. To observe the prosthetic gait, the model of normal gait was altered to replace one of the legs using the model of the prosthesis. The results obtained through this modeling agreed with the results of previous studies with respect to both articular range and spatial-temporal parameters. A kinematic analysis of the model's behavior showed that the prosthesis provides support to the body and allows for an effective gait in the absence of the body part, and the data produced by this analysis of the model's gait pattern correspond to data in the existing literature. In recent years, the usefulness of simulations in the medical context has been observed and verified. This particular simulation should be useful to students who are learning about the biomechanics of prosthetic gait as well as to medical doctors working in this field.},

abstract = {The energetics of muscular exercise at steady state is tightly coupled to, and dependent on, the events that occurred during the transient phase, of which the steady-state is therefore the "memory". The aim of the present study is to show that it is possible to utilize data obtained at exercise steady state to gain information on variables traditionally assessed during exercise transients. A theoretical model based on the steady-state relationships between mechanical power, O2 uptake (V̇O2) and phosphocreatine (PC) split allows us to highlight three interdependent parameters: the time constant of the V̇O2 on response at the muscular level ($\tau$), the mechanical equivalent of PC splitting and the P/O2 ratio. The model was applied to experimental data obtained during moderate calf exercise in humans inside an MR unit. For a P/O2 from 5.6 to 6.2, the obtained $\tau$ values range from 10.6 to 24.9 s (for PC concentrations from 17.8 to 37.7 mmol/kg fresh muscle), and the corresponding mechanical equivalents of PC from 9.6 to 10.6 J/mmol. The analysis also shows that the time constant of the O2 uptake kinetics is strictly dependent on the PC concentration at rest, whereas the mechanical equivalent of PC is unaffected by its concentration.},

These differences may be actual gait-limiting factors and neuromuscular adaptations with age or simply a consciously selected motor pattern to produce a slower gait. The purpose of the study was to compare joint torques and powers of young and elderly adults walking at the same speed. Twelve elderly and fourteen young adults (ages 69 and 21 yr) walked at 1.48 m/s over a force platform while being videotaped. Hip, knee, and ankle torques and powers were calculated from the reaction force and kinematic data. A support torque was calculated as the sum of the three joint torques. Extensor angular impulse during stance and positive work at each joint were derived from the torques and powers. Step length was 4{\%} shorter and cadence was 4{\%} higher in elderly adults (both P {\textless} 0.05) compared with young adults. Support angular impulse was nearly identical between groups, but elderly adults had 58{\%} greater angular impulse and 279{\%} more work at the hip, 50{\%} less angular impulse and 39{\%} less work at the knee, and 23{\%} less angular impulse and 29{\%} less work at the ankle compared with young adults (t-test, all P {\textless} 0.05). Age caused a redistribution of joint torques and powers, with the elderly using their hip extensors more and their knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors less than young adults when walking at the same speed. Along with a reduction in motor and sensory functions, the natural history of aging causes a shift in the locus of function in motor performance.},

Challenges arise from the fact that skeletal muscles evoke torque via FES in a time-varying, nonlinear, and delayed manner. A desired torque trajectory is constructed based on the crank position and determined by the knee joint torque transfer ratio (i.e., kinematic efficiency of the knee), which varies as a periodic function of the crank angle. To cope with this periodicity, a repetitive learning controller is developed to track the desired periodic torque trajectory by stimulating the muscle groups. Concurrently, a sliding-mode controller is designed for the electric motor to maintain cadence tracking throughout the entire crank cycle. A passivity-based analysis is developed to ensure stability of the torque and cadence closed-loop systems.},

abstract = {In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths (0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length (from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations play an important role in solving complex engineering problems and have the potential to revolutionize medical decision making and treatment strategies. In this paper, we combine the rapid model-based design, control systems and powerful numerical method strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with the simulation and human movement dynamics strengths of OpenSim by developing a new interface between the two software tools. OpenSim is integrated with Simulink using the MATLAB S-function mechanism, and the interface is demonstrated using both open-loop and closed-loop control systems. While the open-loop system uses MATLAB/Simulink to separately reproduce the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool, the closed-loop system adds the unique feature of feedback control to OpenSim, which is necessary for most human movement simulations. An arm model example was successfully used in both open-loop and closed-loop cases. For the open-loop case, the simulation reproduced results from the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool with root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.03° for the shoulder elevation angle and 0.06° for the elbow flexion angle. MATLAB's variable step-size integrator reduced the time required to generate the forward dynamic simulation from 7.1. s (OpenSim) to 2.9. s (MATLAB). For the closed-loop case, a proportional-integral-derivative controller was used to successfully balance a pole on model's hand despite random force disturbances on the pole. The new interface presented here not only integrates the OpenSim and MATLAB/Simulink software tools, but also will allow neuroscientists, physiologists, biomechanists, and physical therapists to adapt and generate new solutions as treatments for musculoskeletal conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel orientation algorithm designed to support a computationally efficient, wearable inertial human motion tracking system for rehabilitation applications. It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; {\textless} 0.8° static RMS error, {\textless} 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.},

Training status may influence the effect of fatigue on running kinematics, since well trained, competitive runners are used to running until exhaustion, whereas novice runners are not. This study aimed to determine changes in running kinematics during an exhaustive run in both novice (NOVICE) and competitive (COMP) long-distance runners. About 15 NOVICE and 15 COMP runners performed a treadmill run, until voluntary exhaustion at 3,200 m time trial pace. Joint angles and global trunk and pelvis angles were recorded at the beginning and at the end of the run. In both groups, peak pelvic anterior tilt, pelvic rotation range of motion (both during stance phase) and ankle plantar flexion during swing phase increased after the exhaustive run. There was a significant interaction effect between group and exhaustion for peak forward trunk lean, which increased only in the NOVICE group, and for hip abduction during mid-swing, which increased in NOVICE and decreased in COMP runners. In conclusion, NOVICE runners showed larger kinematic adjustments when exhausted than COMP runners. This may affect their running performance and should be taken into account when assessing a runner's injury risk.},

Ground reaction forces, electromyography, and joint angle data were collected from 20 trained participants while they performed the three movements. Relative to the power clean, the kinematics of the jump squat were more similar to those of the countermovement jump. The order in which the ankle, knee, and hip began extending, as well as the subsequent pattern of extension, was different between the power clean and countermovement jump. The electromyography data demonstrated significant differences in the relative timing of peak activations in all muscles, the maximum activation of the rectus femoris and biceps femoris, and in the activation/deactivation patterns of the vastus medialis and rectus femoris. The greatest rate of force development during the upward phase of these exercises was generated during the power clean (17,254 N {\textperiodcentered} s-1), which was significantly greater than both the countermovement jump (3836 N {\textperiodcentered} s-1) and jump squat (3517 N {\textperiodcentered} s-1) conditions (P {\textless}.001, $\eta$p2 = .88). {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Background: Controllers for assistive robotic devices can be divided into two main categories: controllers using neural signals and controllers using mechanically intrinsic signals. Both approaches are prevalent in research devices, but a direct comparison between the two could provide insight into their relative advantages and disadvantages. We studied subjects walking with robotic ankle exoskeletons using two different control modes: dynamic gain proportional myoelectric control based on soleus muscle activity (neural signal), and timing-based mechanically intrinsic control based on gait events (mechanically intrinsic signal). We hypothesized that subjects would have different measures of metabolic work rate between the two controllers as we predicted subjects would use each controller in a unique manner due to one being dependent on muscle recruitment and the other not. Methods: The two controllers had the same average actuation signal as we used the control signals from walking with the myoelectric controller to shape the mechanically intrinsic control signal. The difference being the myoelectric controller allowed step-to-step variation in the actuation signals controlled by the user's soleus muscle recruitment while the timing-based controller had the same actuation signal with each step regardless of muscle recruitment. Results: We observed no statistically significant difference in metabolic work rate between the two controllers. Subjects walked with 11{\%} less soleus activity during mid and late stance and significantly less peak soleus recruitment when using the timing-based controller than when using the myoelectric controller. While walking with the myoelectric controller, subjects walked with significantly higher average positive and negative total ankle power compared to walking with the timing-based controller. Conclusions: We interpret the reduced ankle power and muscle activity with the timing-based controller relative to the myoelectric controller to result from greater slacking effects. Subjects were able to be less engaged on a muscle level when using a controller driven by mechanically intrinsic signals than when using a controller driven by neural signals, but this had no affect on their metabolic work rate. These results suggest that the type of controller (neural vs. mechanical) is likely to affect how individuals use robotic exoskeletons for therapeutic rehabilitation or human performance augmentation.},

abstract = {Muscles are the actuators that drive human movement. However, despite many decades of work, we still cannot readily assess the forces that muscles transmit during human movement. Direct measurements of muscle-tendon loads are invasive and modeling approaches require many assumptions. Here, we introduce a non-invasive approach to assess tendon loads by tracking vibrational behavior. We first show that the speed of shear wave propagation in tendon increases with the square root of axial stress. We then introduce a remarkably simple shear wave tensiometer that uses micron-scale taps and skin-mounted accelerometers to track tendon wave speeds in vivo. Tendon wave speeds are shown to modulate in phase with active joint torques during isometric exertions, walking, and running. The capacity to non-invasively assess muscle-tendon loading can provide new insights into the motor control and biomechanics underlying movement, and could lead to enhanced clinical treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases.},

abstract = {Robots will become ubiquitously useful only when they can use few attempts to teach themselves to perform different tasks, even with complex bodies and in dynamical environments. Vertebrates, in fact, successfully use trial-and-error to learn multiple tasks in spite of their intricate tendon-driven anatomies. Roboticists find such tendon-driven systems particularly hard to control because they are simultaneously nonlinear, under-determined (many tendon tensions combine to produce few net joint torques), and over-determined (few joint rotations define how many tendons need to be reeled-in/payed-out). We demonstrate---for the first time in simulation and in hardware---how a model-free approach allows few-shot autonomous learning to produce effective locomotion in a 3-tendon/2-joint tendon-driven leg. Initially, an artificial neural network fed by sparsely sampled data collected using motor babbling creates an inverse map from limb kinematics to motor activations, which is analogous to juvenile vertebrates playing during development. Thereafter, iterative reward-driven exploration of candidate motor activations simultaneously refines the inverse map and finds a functional locomotor limit-cycle autonomously. This biologically-inspired algorithm, which we call G2P (General to Particular), enables versatile adaptation of robots to changes in the target task, mechanics of their bodies, and environment. Moreover, this work empowers future studies of few-shot autonomous learning in biological systems, which is the foundation of their enviable functional versatility.},

The link lengths are used to estimate the angle of the bicycle crankshaft. With this measure, the delivery of knee torque is coordinated with the motion of the user. The controller is implemented on a prosthesis prototype and assessed on a transfemoral amputee subject ( N = 1). The subject exhibited a bilateral work asymmetry of 83.5{\%} when cycling with his daily use prosthesis in a free-swing mode. When 60-N{\textperiodcentered}m peak assistance was provided by the powered prosthesis, the bilateral work asymmetry was reduced to 11.4{\%}. The subject's metabolic energy rate was measured for speed and power-matched cycling while the powered prosthesis provided zero assistance (i.e., turned off and providing its back-drive resistance) or 30-N{\textperiodcentered}m peak assistance.

abstract = {Musculoskeletal modeling and marker-based motion capture techniques are commonly used to quantify the motions of body segments, and the forces acting on them during human gait. However, when these techniques are applied to analyze the gait of people with lower limb loss, the clinically relevant interaction between the residual limb and prosthesis socket is typically overlooked. It is known that there is considerable motion and loading at the residuum-socket interface, yet traditional gait analysis techniques do not account for these factors due to the inability to place tracking markers on the residual limb inside of the socket. In the present work, we used a global optimization technique and anatomical constraints to estimate the motion and loading at the residuum-socket interface as part of standard gait analysis procedures. We systematically evaluated a range of parameters related to the residuum-socket interface, such as the number of degrees of freedom, and determined the configuration that yields the best compromise between faithfully tracking experimental marker positions while yielding anatomically realistic residuum-socket kinematics and loads that agree with data from the literature. Application of the present model to gait analysis for people with lower limb loss will deepen our understanding of the biomechanics of walking with a prosthesis, which should facilitate the development of enhanced rehabilitation protocols and improved assistive devices.},

abstract = {Tendon elastic strain energy is the dominant contributor to muscle-tendon work during steady-state running. Does this behaviour also occur for sprint accelerations? We used experimental data and computational modelling to quantify muscle fascicle work and tendon elastic strain energy for the human ankle plantar flexors (specifically soleus and medial gastrocnemius) for multiple foot contacts of a maximal sprint as well as for running at a steady-state speed. Positivework done by the soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscle fascicles decreased incrementally throughout the maximal sprint and both muscles performed more work for the first foot contact of the maximal sprint (FC1) compared with steady-state running at 5 m s-1 (SS5). However, the differences in tendon strain energy for bothmuscleswere negligible throughout the maximal sprint and when comparing FC1 to SS5. Consequently, the contribution ofmuscle fasciclework to stored tendon elastic strain energywas greater for FC1 compared with subsequent foot contacts of the maximal sprint and compared with SS5. We conclude that tendon elastic strain energy in the ankle plantar flexors is just as vital at the start of a maximal sprint as it is at the end, and as it is for running at a constant speed.},

abstract = {We examine two prevailing, yet surprisingly contradictory, theories of human walking. The six determinants of gait are kinematic features of gait proposed to minimize the energetic cost of locomotion by reducing the vertical displacement of the body center of mass (COM). The inverted pendulum analogy proposes that it is beneficial for the stance leg to behave like a pendulum, prescribing a more circular arc, rather than a horizontal path, for the COM. Recent literature presents evidence against the six determinants theory, and a simple mathematical analysis shows that a flattened COM trajectory in fact increases muscle work and force requirements. A similar analysis shows that the inverted pendulum fares better, but paradoxically predicts no work or force requirements. The paradox may be resolved through the dynamic walking approach, which refers to periodic gaits produced almost entirely by the dynamics of the limbs alone. Demonstrations include passive dynamic walking machines that descend a gentle slope, and active dynamic walking robots that walk on level ground. Dynamic walking takes advantage of the inverted pendulum mechanism, but requires mechanical work to transition from one pendular stance leg to the next. We show how the step-to-step transition is an unavoidable energetic consequence of the inverted pendulum gait, and gives rise to predictions that are experimentally testable on humans and machines. The dynamic walking approach provides a new perspective, focusing on mechanical work rather than the kinematics or forces of gait. It is helpful for explaining human gait features in a constructive rather than interpretive manner. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There are an infinite number of ways to control an assistive robotic device; however, there is little consensus on which ways are better than others and why. We designed this study to compare the control of powered ankle exoskeletons using neural measurements to drive control versus that using mechanically intrinsic measurements. The controller driven by neural measurements was a dynamic gain proportional myoelectric controller using user's soleus muscle activity for an actuation signal. The controller driven by mechanically intrinsic measurements was a timing-based controller using detected heel-strikes of the user to appropriately time actuation. We designed these two controllers in such a way that both had the same average actuation signal and tested them with 8 healthy subjects. Results show no significant difference in metabolic work rate between the two controllers. Both controllers resulted in reductions in metabolic work rate of 19{\%} below walking in the devices unpowered. We found that subjects using the timing-based mechanically intrinsic controller exhibited less positive and negative total ankle power than when using the dynamic gain proportional myoelectric controller. This finding was coupled with a reduction of 11.8{\%} in soleus muscle activity. We believe these finding can have large implications for applications in rehabilitation and lend insight to when one controller is more appropriate to use than another.},

The aim of the study was to analyse the changes in participation and performance trends of older ({\textgreater}40 years of age) triathletes between 1986 and 2010 at the Hawaii Ironman triathlon consisting of 3.8 km swimming, 180 km cycling and 42 km running. Swimming, cycling, running and total times of the best male and female triathletes between 18 and 69 years of age who competed in the Hawaii Ironman triathlon were analysed. The relative participation of master triathletes increased during the 1986-2010 period, while the participation of triathletes younger than 40 years of age decreased. Linear regression showed that males older than 44 years and females older than 40 years significantly improved their performances in the three disciplines and in the total time taken to complete the race. Gender differences in total time performance significantly decreased in the same time period for all age groups between the 40-44 and 55-59 years ones. The reasons for these relative improvements of Ironman athlete performances in older age groups remain, however, unknown. Further studies investigating training regimes, competition experience or sociodemographic factors are needed to gain better insights into the phenomenon of increasing participation and improvement of ultra-endurance performance with advancing age. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Aging Association.},

The aims of the study were (1) to analyze the changes in participation and performance trends of master marathon runners between 1980 and 2009, and (2) to compare the gender differences in performance as a function of age across the years. Running times of the best male and female runners between 20 and 79 years of age who competed in the New York City Marathon were analyzed. Gender differences in performance times were analyzed for the top 10 male and female runners between 20 and 65 years of age. The participation of master runners increased during the 1980-2009 period, to a greater extent for females compared to males. During that period, running times of master runners significantly (P{\textless}0.01) decreased for males older than 64 years and for females older than 44 years, respectively. Gender differences in running times decreased over the last three decades but remained relatively stable across the ages during the last decade. These data suggest that male (≥65 years) and female (≥45 years) master runners have probably not yet reached their limits in marathon performance. The relative stability of gender differences in marathon running times across the different age groups over the last decade also suggests that age-related declines in physiological function do not differ between male and female marathoners. {\textcopyright} American Aging Association 2011.},

abstract = {Cerebral palsy (CP) is the result of a static brain lesion which causes spasticity and muscle contracture. The source of the increased passive stiffness in patients is not understood and while whole muscle down to single muscle fibres have been investigated, the smallest functional unit of muscle (the sarcomere) has not been. Muscle biopsies (adductor longus and gracilis) from pediatric patients were obtained (CP n = 9 and control n = 2) and analyzed for mechanical stiffness, in-vivo sarcomere length and titin isoforms. Adductor longus muscle was the focus of this study and the results for sarcomere length showed a significant increase in length for CP (3.6 µm) compared to controls (2.6 µm). Passive stress at the same sarcomere length for CP compared to control was significantly lower in CP and the elastic modulus for the physiological range of muscle was lower in CP compared to control (98.2 kPa and 166.1 kPa, respectively). Our results show that CP muscle at its most reduced level (the myofibril) is more compliant compared to normal, which is completely opposite to what is observed at higher structural levels (single fibres, muscle fibre bundles and whole muscle). It is noteworthy that at the in vivo sarcomere length in CP, the passive forces are greater than normal, purely as a functional of these more compliant sarcomeres operating at long lengths. Titin isoforms were not different between CP and non-CP adductor longus but titin:nebulin was reduced in CP muscle, which may be due to titin loss or an over-expression of nebulin in CP muscles.},

abstract = {The goals of the work reported by this article are two-fold. The first is to develop a dynamic optimization framework for analysis of equipment setup problems in endurance cycling. The second is to illustrate the application of the approach by determining an optimal chainring shape. To achieve these goals, a mathematical model of the pedaling motion for given trajectories of the net joint moments and the rate of change of the chainring radius was derived, and chainring optimization was posed as an optimal control problem. The cost functional produced a chainring shape that reduced the cost of endurance cycling at 250 W and 90 rpm, apparently by taking advantage of mechanical interactions that arise as a natural consequence of the movement. However, the predicted joint moments required larger peak values during phases of significantly increased joint velocity. Thus, the 'optimal' performance predicted by the cost functional appears opposed to expectations based on muscle mechanics and illustrates the need for further analysis of endurance cycling with a physiologically based cost functional. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

However, due to the multiple training aims involved (i.e., bone strengthening, fall- and fall-impact reduction) the design of an effective and highly individualized exercise protocol is far from being trivial, further bearing in mind that subjects should maintain exercise lifelong. A sport-scientific approach that clearly schedules exercise type, exercise parameters, and exercise principles and adequately considers basic principles of bone metabolism and fall risk might be the most promising strategy to address fracture risk in older adults. Apart from sport science and medicine, however it is essential to implement the program in an attractive social setting that enables a regular, individualized and effective, but also safe and joyous, exercise training to facilitate subjects' adherence to this persistent overall prevention strategy.},

abstract = {Bicyclist rolling and aerodynamic resistance parameters are needed to estimate speed and energy expenditure in various travel analysis applications. These parameters have been investigated for sport and professional bicyclists, but better understanding is needed for real-world urban bicyclists. This paper describes a field coast-down test to measure bicycle resistance parameters that can be administered during traveler intercept surveys and generate representative data for advanced bicycle travel models. Mathematical models are developed that expand on past methods by accounting for varying wind and grade and allowing for increased measurement locations per test. A 12-sensor, 100-m test setup is developed, and indoor and outdoor validation tests are performed. The additional measurement locations yield higher precision than the previous three-sensor methods, but as expected, the precision of outdoor tests is lower due to inconsistent wind, grade, and riding surface. Outdoor validation tests generate rolling resistance coefficient estimates of 0.0064 ± 0.0013 and effective frontal area estimates of 0.63 ± 0.11 m2. Outdoor tests in a headwind are sufficiently sensitive to identify significant changes in resistance with riding position and tire pressure and are expected to generate realistic parameter estimates for parsimonious modeling of on-road bicyclists.},

abstract = {Lower extremity robotic prostheses and exoskeletons can require tuning a large number of control parameters on a subject-specific basis to reduce users' metabolic power during locomotion. We refer to the functional relationship between control parameter configurations and users' metabolic power as the metabolic cost landscape. Standard practice for estimating a metabolic cost landscape, and thus identifying optimal parameter configurations, is to vary control parameters while measuring steady-state metabolic power during walking. This approach is time consuming, tedious, and inefficient. We have developed an instantaneous cost mapping analysis that allows for an estimate of the metabolic cost landscape without the explicit need for steady-state measurements. Here we present novel methods to quantify the confidence in an estimated metabolic cost landscape, allowing for an objective subject-specific comparison of protocols regardless of which metabolic analysis is used. We validated these techniques by estimating metabolic cost landscapes for healthy subjects walking with bilateral robotic ankle exoskeletons using a standard practice protocol and two innovative protocols that use an instantaneous cost mapping analysis. All cost landscapes were a function of the devices' actuation timing. Results showed that for this device a protocol using an instantaneous cost mapping analysis could accurately identify optimal parameter configurations in 20 min, where the standard practice protocol required 42 min. Additionally, using an instantaneous cost mapping analysis with the standard practice's parameter exploration significantly improved fit confidence. These methods could greatly improve real-time optimization of robotic assistive devices or studies focused on biomechanical manipulations of locomotion. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY We are presenting novel subject-specific metabolic cost landscape confidence analyses. These confidence analyses can greatly improve experimental design, intersubject analysis, and the comparison of landscape mapping protocols.

abstract = {Physiological measures, such as pain, anxiety, effort, or energy consumption, play a crucial role in the evaluation and development of assistive robotic devices. Physiological data are collected and analyzed by researchers and clinicians, and are often used to inform an iterative tuning process of a device and its controller. Currently, these data are collected then analyzed offline such that they are only evaluated after the experiment has ended. This makes any iterative design process tedious and time consuming since tuning must be done on a subject-by-subject basis and for a variety of tasks that the device is intended to be used for. To overcome these drawbacks, we are proposing a new type of human-machine interaction that is based on measuring and using physiological measurements in real-time. By continuously monitoring a physiological objective through a set of suitable sensors, we propose conducting an optimization of a set of controller parameters that shape the assistance provided by the device. In other words, we pose an optimization that includes the human body in the loop. This Body-in-the-Loop optimization allows for optimal subject specific control and has the potential to be used for controller adaptation to changing environments. We validated this concept in an extensive human subject study where we autonomously optimized the actuation onset of a pair of bilateral ankle exoskeletons to minimize user's metabolic effort.},

abstract = {Background: Robotic ankle exoskeletons can provide assistance to users and reduce metabolic power during walking. Our research group has investigated the use of proportional myoelectric control for controlling robotic ankle exoskeletons. Previously, these controllers have relied on a constant gain to map user's muscle activity to actuation control signals. A constant gain may act as a constraint on the user, so we designed a controller that dynamically adapts the gain to the user's myoelectric amplitude. We hypothesized that an adaptive gain proportional myoelectric controller would reduce metabolic energy expenditure compared to walking with the ankle exoskeleton unpowered because users could choose their preferred control gain. Methods: We tested eight healthy subjects walking with the adaptive gain proportional myoelectric controller with bilateral ankle exoskeletons. The adaptive gain was updated each stride such that on average the user's peak muscle activity was mapped to maximal power output of the exoskeleton. All subjects participated in three identical training sessions where they walked on a treadmill for 50 minutes (30 minutes of which the exoskeleton was powered) at 1.2 ms-1. We calculated and analyzed metabolic energy consumption, muscle recruitment, inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and exoskeleton mechanics. Results: Using our controller, subjects achieved a metabolic reduction similar to that seen in previous work in about a third of the training time. The resulting controller gain was lower than that seen in previous work ($\beta$=1.50±0.14 versus a constant $\beta$=2). The adapted gain allowed users more total ankle joint power than that of unassisted walking, increasing ankle power in exchange for a decrease in hip power. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that humans prefer to walk with greater ankle mechanical power output than their unassisted gait when provided with an ankle exoskeleton using an adaptive controller. This suggests that robotic assistance from an exoskeleton can allow humans to adopt gait patterns different from their normal choices for locomotion. In our specific experiment, subjects increased ankle power and decreased hip power to walk with a reduction in metabolic cost. Future exoskeleton devices that rely on proportional myolectric control are likely to demonstrate improved performance by including an adaptive gain.},

abstract = {The motor unit is composed of the motoneuron, its axon branching within a muscle, and the innervated muscle fibers. There are three types of motor units: slow (S), fast resistant to fatigue (FR), and fast fatigable (FF). Differences between them concern morphological and electrophysiological properties of motoneurons, a number, morphology, biochemical characteristics, and metabolism of muscle fibers forming each unit, contractile times, forces and fatigue resistance. Recruitment of motor units into a contraction depends on the excitability of motoneurons and correlates with the properties of muscle fibers. The number of active units, their position and mutual relations within a muscle as well as frequencies and patterns of discharges generated by motoneurons determine the muscle force during subsequent phases of movement. The properties of motoneurons and motor units are subject to plastic modifications during development and aging, as a result of various forms of motor activity or disease. The motor unit activity is closely connected to the muscle receptors, primarily muscle spindles, and tendon organs which send information about the spatial position of the body and the limbs to the central nervous system, thus contributing to the control of precise movements.},

abstract = {Objective: This narrative review summarizes findings for Ironman triathlon performance and intends to determine potential predictor variables for Ironman race performance in female and male triathletes. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed using the terms " Ironman " , " triathlon " , and " performance " . All resulting articles were searched for related citations. Results: Age, previous experience, sex, training, origin, anthropometric and physiological characteristics, pacing, and performance in split disciplines were predictive. Differences exist between the sexes for anthropometric characteristics. The most important predictive variables for a fast Ironman race time were age of 30–35 years (women and men), a fast personal best time in Olympic distance triathlon (women and men), a fast personal best time in marathon (women and men), high volume and high speed in training where high volume was more important than high speed (women and men), low body fat, low skin-fold thicknesses and low circumference of upper arm (only men), and origin from the United States of America (women and men). Conclusion: These findings may help athletes and coaches to plan an Ironman triathlon career. Age and previous experience are important to find the right point in the life of a triathlete to switch from the shorter triathlon distances to the Ironman distance. Future studies need to correlate physiological characteristics such as maximum oxygen uptake with Ironman race time to investigate their potential predictive value and to investigate socio-economic aspects in Ironman triathlon.},

abstract = {The maximum force-generating capacity of a muscle is dependent on the lengths and velocities of its contractile apparatus. Muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length changes can be estimated from joint kinematics; however, contractile element length changes are more difficult to predict during dynamic contractions. The aim of this study was to compare vastus lateralis (VL) MTU and fascicle level force-length and forcevelocity relationships, and dynamic muscle function while cycling at a constant submaximal power output (2.5 W/kg) with different cadences. We hypothesized that manipulating cadence at a constant power output would not affect VL MTU shortening, but significantly affect VL fascicle shortening. Furthermore, these differences would affect the predicted force capacity of the muscle. Using an isokinetic dynamometer and B-mode ultrasound (US), we determined the forcelength and force-velocity properties of the VL MTU and its fascicles. In addition, three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics of the lower limb, as well as US images of VL fascicles were collected during submaximal cycling at cadences of 40, 60, 80, and 100 rotations per minute. Ultrasound measures revealed a significant increase in fascicle shortening as cadence decreased (84{\%} increase across all conditions, P {\textless} 0.01), whereas there were no significant differences in MTU lengths across any of the cycling conditions (maximum of 6{\%}). The MTU analysis resulted in greater predicted force capacity across all conditions relative to the force-velocity relationship (P {\textless} 0.01). These results reinforce the need to determine muscle mechanics in terms of separate contractile element and connective tissue length changes during isokinetic contractions, as well as dynamic movements like cycling. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate that vastus lateralis (VL) muscle tendon unit (MTU) length changes do not adequately reflect the underlying fascicle mechanics during cycling. When examined across different pedaling cadence conditions, the force-generating potential measured only at the level of MTU (or joint) overestimated the maximum force capacity of VL compared with analysis using fascicle level data.},

Moreover, cardiac energetics should be an important consideration in the choice and application of drugs especially in the case of vasodilators, inotropic agents and in cardioprotective measures. Only by considering energetics at the subcellular, cellular, and whole-heart level we can arrive at a better understanding of cardiac performance and ultimately better clinical judgement and drug therapy. Quantification of myocardial energetics will also help to determine the optimal time for surgical interventions such as valvular replacement or aneurysm resection. The present volume is the outcome of an international symposium on cardiac energetics held in Gargellen/Montafon (Austria), June 1986. The contributions will certainly help bridge the existing gap between basic research involving isolated structures and that involving the whole organ, on the one hand, and render the results derived from basic research applicable to clinical problems, on the other hand.},

abstract = {During prolonged running, the magnitude of Achilles tendon (AT) length change may increase, resulting in increased tendon strain energy return with each step. AT elongation might also affect the magnitude of triceps surae (TS) muscle shortening and shortening velocity, requiring greater activation and increased muscle energy cost. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the tendon strain energy return and muscle energy cost necessary to allow energy storage to occur prior to and following prolonged running. 14 trained male (n = 10) and female (n = 4) distance runners (24±4 years, 1.72±0.09 m, 61±10 kg, V̇O 2 max 64.6±5.8 ml•kg -1 •min -1 ) ran 90 minutes (RUN) at approximately 85{\%} of lactate threshold speed (sLT). Prior to and following RUN, AT stiffness and running energy cost (E run ) at 85{\%} sLT were determined. AT energy return was calculated from AT stiffness, measured with dynamometry and ultrasound and estimated TS force during stance. TS energy cost was estimated on the basis of AT force and assumed crossbridge mechanics and energetics. Following RUN, AT stiffness was reduced from 328±172 N•mm -1 to 299±148 N•mm -1 (p = 0.022). E run increased from 4.56±0.32 J•kg -1 •m -1 to 4.62±0.32 J•kg -1 •m -1 (p = 0.049). Estimated AT energy return was not different following RUN (p = 0.99). Estimated TS muscle energy cost increased significantly by 11.8±12.3 J•stride -1 , (p = 0.0034), accounting for much of the post-RUN increase in E run (8.6±14.5 J•stride -1 ,r 2 = 0.31). These results demonstrate that a prolonged, submaximal run can reduce AT stiffness and increase E run in trained runners, and that the elevated TS energy cost contributes substantially to the elevated E run .},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to gain insight into how ankle exoskeletons affect the behavior of the plantarflexor muscles during walking. Using data from previous experiments, we performed electromyographydriven simulations of musculoskeletal dynamics to explore how changes in exoskeleton assistance affected plantarflexor muscle-tendon mechanics, particularly for the soleus. We used a model of muscle energy consumption to estimate individual muscle metabolic rate. As average exoskeleton torque was increased, while no net exoskeleton work was provided, a reduction in tendon recoil led to an increase in positive mechanical work performed by the soleus muscle fibers. As net exoskeleton work was increased, both soleus muscle fiber force and positive mechanical work decreased. Trends in the sum of the metabolic rates of the simulated muscles correlated well with trends in experimentally observed whole-body metabolic rate (R2=0.9), providing confidence in our model estimates. Our simulation results suggest that different exoskeleton behaviors can alter the functioning of the muscles and tendons acting at the assisted joint. Furthermore, our results support the idea that the series tendon helps reduce positive work done by the muscle fibers by storing and returning energy elastically. We expect the results from this study to promote the use of electromyography-driven simulations to gain insight into the operation of muscle-tendon units and to guide the design and control of assistive devices.},

abstract = {In rowing, mechanical power output is a key parameter for biophysical analyses and performance monitoring and should therefore be measured accurately. It is common practice to estimate on-water power output as the time average of the dot product of the moment of the handle force relative to the oar pin and the oar angular velocity. In a theoretical analysis we have recently shown that this measure differs from the true power output by an amount that equals the mean of the rower's mass multiplied by the rower's center of mass acceleration and the velocity of the boat. In this study we investigated the difference between a rower's power output calculated using the common proxy and the true power output under different rowing conditions. Nine rowers participated in an on-water experiment consisting of 7 trials in a single scull. Stroke rate, technique and forces applied to the oar were varied. On average, rowers' power output was underestimated with 12.3{\%} when determined using the common proxy. Variations between rowers and rowing conditions were small (SD = 1.1{\%}) and mostly due to differences in stroke rate. To analyze and monitor rowing performance accurately, a correction of the determination of rowers' on-water power output is therefore required.},

The average of two lifts performed on separate days was completed by 16 women (165 cm; 61.1 kg; 21.8 years) and 22 men (180.5 cm; 83 kg; 23.7 years). Overall 40 data points (the averages of 80 lifts) were plotted and correlations completed within each exercise for work and total energy costs: deadlift r = 0.997, squat r = 0.977, incline press r = 0.947, shoulder shrug r = 0.921 and calf raise r = 0.941 (p {\textless} 0.05). The amount of oxygen consumed during exercise for each lift represented the lowest energy cost contribution (18{\%}), followed by anaerobic (31{\%}) and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC, 51{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.05). The identification of work (J) along with an estimate of the total energy costs (kJ) revealed remarkably consistent relationships within any given resistance exercise, leading to a predictable increase in the cost of lifting for each exercise.

Historically, force platforms used to collect kinetic data are housed within laboratory settings and are not suitable for field-based installation. Given that Newton's Second Law clearly describes the relationship between a body's mass, acceleration, and resultant force, is it possible that marker-based motion capture can represent these parameters sufficiently enough to estimate GRF/Ms, and thereby minimize our reliance on surface embedded force platforms? Specifically, can we successfully use partial least squares (PLS) regression to learn the relationship between motion capture and GRF/Ms data? In total, we analyzed 11 PLS methods and achieved average correlation coefficients of 0.9804 for GRFs and 0.9143 for GRMs. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting accurate GRF/Ms from raw motion capture trajectories in real-time, overcoming what has been a significant barrier to non-invasive collection of such data.

abstract = {Although motoneurons have often been considered to be fairly linear transducers of synaptic input, recent evidence suggests that strong persistent inward currents (PICs) in motoneurons allow neuromodulatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to induce large nonlinearities in the relation between the level of excitatory input and motor output. To try to estimate the possible extent of this nonlinearity, we developed a pool of model motoneurons designed to replicate the characteristics of motoneuron input-output properties measured in medial gastrocnemius motoneurons in the decerebrate cat with voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques. We drove the model pool with a range of synaptic inputs consisting of various mixtures of excitation, inhibition, and neuromodulation. We then looked at the relation between excitatory drive and total pool output. Our results revealed that the PICs not only enhance gain but also induce a strong nonlinearity in the relation between the average firing rate of the motoneuron pool and the level of excitatory input. The relation between the total simulated force output and input was somewhat more linear because of higher force outputs in later-recruited units. We also found that the nonlinearity can be increased by increasing neuromodulatory input and/or balanced inhibitory input and minimized by a reciprocal, push-pull pattern of inhibition. We consider the possibility that a flexible input-output function may allow motor output to be tuned to match the widely varying demands of the normal motor repertoire. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Motoneuron activity is generally considered to reflect the level of excitatory drive. However, the activation of voltage-dependent intrinsic conductances can distort the relation between excitatory drive and the total output of a pool of motoneurons. Using a pool of realistic motoneuron models, we show that pool output can be a highly nonlinear function of synaptic input but linearity can be achieved through adjusting the time course of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.},

abstract = {The relationship between power and gross efficiency during near-maximal rowing, and physiological measures of strength, power, aerobic and anaerobic capacities and United State Rowing Association (USRA) performance tests (independent variables) was investigated among collegiate male rowers. Criterion measures of rowing power and gross efficiency were measured in a moving-water rowing tank, using an oar instrumented with strain gauges to assess force and a potentiometer to assess oar position. Bivariate correlation analysis (n = 28) indicated no relationship between the independent variables and rowing gross efficiency (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Rowing power [mean (SD) 483.4 (34.75) W] was significantly related to inboard leg extension strength (IL strength, r = 0.63), outboard leg extension strength (r = 0.45), combined leg extension strength (r = 0.45), and time to complete the USRA 2000-m simulated rowing race (r = -0.52; P {\textless} 0.05). Stepwise regression using resampling cross-validation of 15 random samples (21 subjects per sample selected from a total group of 28 intercollegiate oarsmen) indicated that predictors of rowing power were IL strength and blood lactate following a peak oxygen uptake rowing test with significant multiple correlations of R = 0.61 to 0.86 (P {\textless} 0.05). The standard error of estimate (SEM) ranged from 18.1 to 29.9 W, or 5.3 (0.77){\%} of the criterion value. Cross-validation with a hold-but group (seven subjects per sample) was performed for each equation and correlations ranged from R = 0.14 to 0.97 (SEM = 8.0 to 38.9 W). In conclusion, data from the present study suggest that to increase rowing power, training should emphasize leg strength and anaerobic training to decrease the level of lactate accumulated during rowing.},

abstract = {The ‘cost of generating force' hypothesis proposes that the metabolic rate during running is determined by the rate of muscle force development (1/tc, where tc=contact time) and the volume of active leg muscle. A previous study assumed a constant recruited muscle volume and reported that the rate of force development alone explained ∼70{\%} of the increase in metabolic rate for human runners across a moderate velocity range (2–4 m s−1). We hypothesized that over a wider range of velocities, the effective mechanical advantage (EMA) of the lower limb joints would overall decrease, necessitating a greater volume of active muscle recruitment.

abstract = {The ‘cost of generating force' hypothesis proposes that the metabolic rate during running is determined by the rate of muscle force development (1/tc, where tc=contact time) and the volume of active leg muscle. A previous study assumed a constant recruited muscle volume and reported that the rate of force development alone explained ∼70{\%} of the increase in metabolic rate for human runners across a moderate velocity range (2–4 m s−1). We hypothesized that over a wider range of velocities, the effective mechanical advantage (EMA) of the lower limb joints would overall decrease, necessitating a greater volume of active muscle recruitment.

abstract = {The metabolic energy that human walking requires can vary by more than 10-fold, depending on the speed, surface gradient, and load carried. Although the mechanical factors determining economy are generally considered to be numerous and complex, we tested a minimum mechanics hypothesis that only three variables are needed for broad, accurate prediction: speed, surface grade, and total gravitational load. We first measured steady-state rates of oxygen uptake in 20 healthy adult subjects during unloaded treadmill trials from 0.4 to 1.6 m/s on six gradients: -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, and 9°. Next, we tested a second set of 20 subjects under three torso-loading conditions (no-load, +18, and +31{\%} body weight) at speeds from 0.6 to 1.4 m/s on the same six gradients. Metabolic rates spanned a 14-fold range from supine rest to the greatest single-trial walking mean (3.1 ± 0.1 to 43.3 ± 0.5 ml O2{\textperiodcentered}kg-body-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1, respectively). As theorized, the walking portion (V? O2-walk- V ? O2-gross- V ? O2-supine-rest) of the body's gross metabolic rate increased in direct proportion to load and largely in accordance with support force requirements across both speed and grade. Consequently, a single minimum-mechanics equation was derived from the data of 10 unloaded-condition subjects to predict the pooled mass-specific economy (V? O2-gross, ml O2{\textperiodcentered}kg-body- load -1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) of all the remaining loaded and unloaded trials combined (n- 1,412 trials from 90 speed/grade/load conditions). The accuracy of prediction achieved (r2 = 0.99, SEE- 1.06 ml O2{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) leads us to conclude that human walking economy is predictably determined by the minimum mechanical requirements present across a broad range of conditions. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Introduced is a "minimum mechanics" model that predicts human walking economy across a broad range of conditions from only three variables: speed, surface grade, and bodyplus- load mass. The derivation/validation data set includes steadystate loaded and unloaded walking trials (n = 3,414) that span a fourfold range of walking speeds on each of six different surface gradients (-6 to +9°). The accuracy of our minimum mechanics model (r2 = 0.99; SEE = 1.06 ml O2{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) appreciably exceeds that of currently used standards.},

abstract = {The scaling of bone and muscle geometry in mammals suggests that peak stresses (ratio of force to cross-sectional area) acting in these two support elements increase with increasing body size. Observations of stresses acting in the limb bones of different sized mammals during strenuous activity, however, indicate that peak bone stress is independent of size (maintaining a safety factor of between 2 and 4). It appears that similar peak bone stresses and muscle stresses in large and small mammals are achieved primarily by a size-dependent change in locomotor limb posture: small animals run with crouched postures, whereas larger species run more upright. By adopting an upright posture, large animals align their limbs more closely with the ground reaction force, substantially reducing the forces that their muscles must exert (proportional to body mass0.74) and hence, the forces that their bones must resist, to counteract joint moments. This change in limb posture to maintain locomotor stresses within safe limits, however, likely limits the maneuverability and accelerative capability of large animals.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper was to evaluate a new set of biomechanical parameters for performance assessment in laboratory sprint cycling. Two groups of seven cyclists, one at elite level, the other at regional level, performed sprint tests in seated and standing positions against 0.8 N/kg resistive loads on the T1670 Basic ergo-trainer (Tacx, Netherlands). A classic racing bicycle was equipped with an SRM Training System (Schoberer, Germany). Two sets of biomechanical parameters were defined: one “classical” and one “new” set of parameters. The relation between crank torque and crank angle was carefully studied and a selection of characteristic criteria for assessing the cycling performance was proposed. In order to quantify the differences in the pedalling technique, new criteria were introduced, such as the time interval during which the instantaneous power exceeded 90 {\%} of the maximal power output as a proportion of the pedal downstroke (RMPD90). The results show 1) that the cyclo cross cyclists can generated high level of power output during sprint test (close to 18W/kg) and 2) there is no significant difference between regional level and elite level concerning the set of biomechanical parameters classically employed. However, the new set of biomechanical parameters (RMPD90) revealed differences between the pedalling characteristics of the elite level and regional level groups. The results of the present study suggest that the analysis of the sprint test performed with classical set of biomechanical parameters can be completed using the RMPD90 as a supplementary fitness criterion},

abstract = {A person constrained to walk at a given speed v on a treadmill, chooses a particular step frequency f and step length d = v/f. Testing over a range of speeds generates a speed-frequency (v-f) relationship. This relationship is commonly posited as a basic feature of human gait. It is often further posited that this curve follows from minimum energy cost strategy. We observed that individuals walking under different constraint circumstances - walking to a range of fixed metronome frequencies (fixed f) or over a range of spaced markers (fixed d) - produce speed-frequency relations distinct from the constrained v relation. We show here that three distinct speed-frequency curves, similar to those observed, are predicted by the assumption that a walking person optimizes an underlying objective function F(v,f) that has a minimum at the preferred gait. Further, the metabolic cost of transport is a reasonable approximate candidate for the function F. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews a number of historical contributions of neurophysiology to clinical neurology in the hundred years that have elapsed since the publication of Sherrington's The Integrative Action of the Nervous System, a book generally considered the neurophysiologist's bible. In the past, many normal nervous functions have been inferred from disorderly functions in animals by neurophysiologists and in humans by clinical neurologists. If neurophysiologists have undoubtedly learned much from experimental lesions in animals, it has been the clinical neurologists who have obtained first-hand information on the effects of pathology on the functioning of the most complex and interesting of all nervous systems, that of man. Currently this division of labor is less clear, and convergent evidence from neurophysiology and clinical neurology alike has set our current knowledge about brain functions on a firm comparative foundation. This review of the relations between neurophysiology and clinical neurology reports contributions that have been recognized as "historical" by the scientific community because of their documented impact on the development of the entire field of neurosciences. The inclusion of further less famous neurophysiological achievements is justified by their potential influence on the advancement of neuroscience, as seen from the author's personal viewpoint. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of low-and high-velocity resistance training on isokinetic peak torque and anaerobic power output. Eighteen male varsity oarsmen were blocked on peak knee extension torque at 3.14 rad s–1 and assigned to a high-velocity resistance training group (HVR), a low-velocity resistance training group (LVR) or a control group. Subjects trained four times a week for 5 weeks. Each training session included three circuits of 12 stations using variable-resistance hydraulic equipment. The HVR training significantly improved peak torque (P0.05) in knee extension and flexion at 2.61, 3.14, 3.66 and 4.19rads-1. The LVR training produced significant improvements (P0.05) in peak torque for knee extension and flexion at 0.52, 1.05, 1.57 and 2.61 rad s-1. High positive correlations were found between peak torque and anaerobic power outputs for all groups. However, no significant changes occurred in 15 s power output, average 90 s power output or peak blood lactate in either training group. These results indicate that velocity-specific strength training does not necessarily improve anaerobic power output in a different exercise mode despite the high positive correlation between isokinetic strength and anaerobic power output. {\textcopyright} 1989 E. {\&} F.N.

abstract = {The general aim of this study was to examine the relations between rigging set up, anthropometry, physical capacity, rowing kinematics and rowing performance. Fifteen elite single scullers participated in the experiment. Each sculler's preferred rigging set‐up was quantified using measurements that included oar length, inboard, span, gearing ratio, swivel‐seat height, footstretcher‐seat height and distance, and footstretcher angles. Rowing performance was assessed using 2000 m race times from the Australian National Selection trials. Selected anthropometric, physical capacity and kinematic variables were also quantified. Several rigging variables were significantly correlated with each other, and with various anthropometric, physical capacity and kinematic variables. The individual variables that had the highest correlations with race time were 2 km ergometer time (r=0.90), mass (r = ‐0.87), height (r = ‐0.86), oar length (r = ‐0.85) and strength (r = ‐0.84). Overall results of this study indicated that the fastest rowers tend to be the largest and strongest, and that these larger body dimensions are reflected in the choice of rigging settings. Rigging set‐up by itself should not be considered to be a primary determinant of rowing performance, but rather a consequence of faster rowers being larger and stronger and scaling their rigging set‐up accordingly. To maximise rowing performance it appears important to tune the rigging of the boat to match the rower's size and strength. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

A group of 54 highly trained rowers (31 heavyweight [HW] and 23 lightweight [LW] rowers) was studied. Body mass, maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max), oxygen consumption corresponding to a blood lactate of 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}l-1 expressed in percentage of V̇O2max (V̇O2La4{\%}), and rowing gross efficiency (RGE) were also determined during the incremental i test. In the whole group Ppeak was the best predictor of P2000 (r = 0.92, p {\textless} 0.0001). Body mass (r = 0.65, p {\textless} 0.0001), V̇O2max (r = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.0001), V̇O2La4{\%} (r = 0.49, p {\textless} 0.0001) and RGE (r = 0.35, p {\textless} 0.01) were significantly correlated with P2000 as well. To take the influence of body mass into account, V̇O2max was related to kg0.57. Ppeak was significantly related to body mass (r = 0.56, p{\textless}0.0001), V̇O2max{\textperiodcentered}kg-0.57 (r = 0.63. p {\textless} 0.0001), V̇O2La4{\%} (r = 0.45, p {\textless} 0.001) and RGE (r = 0.34, p {\textless} 0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that the above parameters taken together explained 82.8{\%} of Ppeak variation in the whole group. It was also demonstrated that Ppeak was the best predictor of P2000 when LW and HW groups were considered separately. It was concluded that, by integrating the main physiological factors of performance, Ppeak is an overall index of physiological rowing capacity and rowing efficiency in heterogeneous as well as in homogeneous groups. It presents the further advantage of being easily measured in the field.},

This offline process involves a robust statistical estimation of the size of the skeleton and an inverse kinematic optimization to produce the desired joint angle trajectories. Additionally, we discuss a variation on the inverse kinematic optimization which can be used when the standard approach does not yield satisfactory results for the special cases when joint angle consistency is desired between a group of motions.

Our objective was to explore and describe these factors among squad members of a university-based, elite Olympic distance triathlete developmental programme. Method A qualitative investigation using a visual communication tool-assisted focus group and longitudinal semistructured individual interviews was conducted. Responses were solicited from the University of Southern Denmark's elite triathlon team (n=8), and inductive coding from the focus group formed the basis of questions for the two rounds of individual interviews 11 months apart. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and then analysed thematically. Results Seventeen context-relevant factors were identified and 10 themes emerged, these being the cold weather ritual', digestive system conditioning', the curse of the night owl', the strings attached to sponsorship', my coach - my rock', mood maintenance', the asynchronous training rhythm', psychological slavery', the legacy of the asphalt tattoo' and the tension of family and friends'. Conclusions By reflecting on their personal training vortex, elite triathletes were able to provide context-relevant insights into the maintenance of training quality over the course of a competitive season. Further research is required to elucidate whether and how biopsycholosocial factors can be modified to optimise the achievement of training goals.},

abstract = {This study quantified the biomechanical (movements and forces) and physiological (energy expenditure) demands of postal delivery performed with electrically assisted bicycles (EABs). Ten postal workers and 10 recreational athletes performed three simulated postal tasks (simulated mail delivery circuit, delivery distance [close vs. far], and 3-min stationary cycling) while carrying 0, 16 and 32 kg. Physiological (energy expenditure) and biomechanical (internal and external forces and joint angles) responses were calculated. Energy expenditure (10–20{\%}; p {\textless} 0.05) and power output (30–44{\%}; p {\textless} 0.05) increased with increasing mail loads. Ground reaction force increased (∼10{\%}) for the far delivery distance, but joint reaction forces were unchanged. Lower hip flexion (p {\textless} 0.01), less hip abduction (p {\textless} 0.01) and larger spine anterior flexion (p {\textless} 0.01) were observed for the far delivery distance. Joint forces were not affected by the mail load transported (0–32 kg) or distance from the mailbox (close vs far). EABs can provide a suitable transportation method to assist mail delivery in terms of energy expenditure reduction.},

abstract = {Such simple things, And we make of them something so complex it defeats us, Almost. —John Ashbery (b. 1927), American poet Every digital device—be it a personal computer, a cellular telephone, or a network router—is based on a set of chips designed to store and process information. Al-though these chips come in different shapes and forms, they are all made from the same building blocks: Elementary logic gates. The gates can be physically imple-mented in many different materials and fabrication technologies, but their logical behavior is consistent across all computers. In this chapter we start out with one primitive logic gate—Nand—and build all the other logic gates from it. The result is a rather standard set of gates, which will be later used to construct our computer's processing and storage chips. This will be done in chapters 2 and 3, respectively. All the hardware chapters in the book, beginning with this one, have the same structure. Each chapter focuses on a well-defined task, designed to construct or inte-grate a certain family of chips. The prerequisite knowledge needed to approach this task is provided in a brief Background section. The next section provides a complete Specification of the chips' abstractions, namely, the various services that they should deliver, one way or another. Having presented the what, a subsequent Implemen-tation section proposes guidelines and hints about how the chips can be actually implemented. A Perspective section rounds up the chapter with concluding com-ments about important topics that were left out from the discussion. Each chapter ends with a technical Project section. This section gives step-by-step instructions for actually building the chips on a personal computer, using the hardware simulator supplied with the book. This being the first hardware chapter in the book, the Background section is somewhat lengthy, featuring a special section on hardware description and simulation tools. 1.1 Background This chapter focuses on the construction of a family of simple chips called Boolean gates. Since Boolean gates are physical implementations of Boolean functions, we start with a brief treatment of Boolean algebra. We then show how Boolean gates implementing simple Boolean functions can be interconnected to deliver the func-tionality of more complex chips. We conclude the background section with a descrip-tion of how hardware design is actually done in practice, using software simulation tools.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by summing five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather, only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

abstract = {Energy consumption is one of the problems for bipedal robots walking. For the purpose of studying the parameter effects on the design of energetic walking bipeds with strong adaptability, we use a dynamic optimization method on our new walking model to first investigate the effects of the mechanical parameters, including mass and length distribution, on the walking efficiency. Then, we study the energetic walking gait features with the combinations of walking speed and step length. Our walking model is designed upon Srinivasan's model. Dynamic optimization is used for a free search with minimal constraints. The results show that the cost of transport of a certain gait increases with the increase in the mass and length distribution parameters, except for that the cost of transport decreases with big length distribution parameter and long step length. We can also find a corresponding range of walking speed and step length, in which the variation in one of the two parameters has no obvious effect on the cost of transport. With fixed mechanical parameters, the cost of transport increases with the increase in the walking speed. There is a speed-step length relationship for walking with minimal cost of transport. The hip torque output strategy is adjusted in two situations to meet the walking requirements.},

abstract = {Biomechanics has made large contributions to dinosaur biology. It has enabled us to estimate both the speeds at which dinosaurs generally moved and the maximum speeds of which they may have been capable. It has told us about the range of postures they could have adopted, for locomotion and for feeding, and about the problems of blood circulation in sauropods with very long necks. It has made it possible to calculate the bite forces of predators such as Tyrannosaurus, and the stresses they imposed on its skull; and to work out the remarkable chewing mechanism of hadrosaurs. It has shown us how some dinosaurs may have produced sounds. It has enabled us to estimate the effectiveness of weapons such as the tail spines of Stegosaurus. In recent years, techniques such as computational tomography and finite element analysis, and advances in computer modelling, have brought new opportunities. Biomechanists should, however, be especially cautious in their work on animals known only as fossils. The lack of living specimens and even soft tissues oblige us to make many assumptions.

abstract = {To achieve the required generality, models designed to predict scaling relationships for diverse groups of animals generally need to be simple. An argument based on considerations of dynamic similarity predicts correctly that the mechanical cost of transport for running [power/(body mass x speed)] will be independent of body mass; but measurements of oxygen consumption for running birds and mammals show that the metabolic cost of transport is proportional to (body mass)-0.32. Thus the leg muscles seem to work more efficiently in larger animals. A model that treats birds as fixed wing aircraft predicts that the mechanical power required for flight at the maximum range speed will be proportional to (body mass)1.02, but the metabolic power is found to be proportional to (body mass)0.83; again, larger animals seem to have more efficient muscles. A model that treats hovering hummingbirds and insects as helicopters predicts mechanical power to be approximately proportional to body mass, but measurements of oxygen consumption once again show efficiency increasing with body mass. A model of swimming fish as rigid submarines predicts power to be proportional to (body mass) 0.5x(speed)2.5 or to (body mass)0.6x(speed) 2.8, depending on whether flow in the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. Unfortunately, this prediction cannot easily be compared with available compilations of metabolic data. The finding that efficiency seems to increase with body mass, at least in running and flight, is discussed in relation to the metabolic energy costs of muscular work and force.},

abstract = {Conceptual, physical and mathematical models have all proved useful in biomechanics. Conceptual models, which have been used only occasionally, clarify a point without having to be constructed physically or analysed mathematically. Some physical models are designed to demonstrate a proposed mechanism, for example the folding mechanisms of insect wings. Others have been used to check the conclusions of mathematical modelling. However, others facilitate observations that would be difficult to make on real organisms, for example on the flow of air around the wings of small insects. Mathematical models have been used more often than physical ones. Some of them are predictive, designed for example to calculate the effects of anatomical changes on jumping performance, or the pattern of flow in a 3D assembly of semicircular canals. Others seek an optimum, for example the best possible technique for a high jump. A few have been used in inverse optimization studies, which search for variables that are optimized by observed patterns of behaviour. Mathematical models range from the extreme simplicity of some models of walking and running, to the complexity of models that represent numerous body segments and muscles, or elaborate bone shapes. The simpler the model, the clearer it is which of its features is essential to the calculated effect.},

abstract = {In this holistic review of cycling science, the objectives are: (1) to identify the various human and environmental factors that influence cycling power output and velocity; (2) to discuss, with the aid of a schematic model, the often complex interrelationships between these factors; and (3) to suggest future directions for research to help clarify how cycling performance can be optimized, given different race disciplines, environments and riders. Most successful cyclists, irrespective of the race discipline, have a high maximal aerobic power output measured from an incremental test, and an ability to work at relatively high power outputs for long periods. The relationship between these characteristics and inherent physiological factors such as muscle capilliarization and muscle fibre type is complicated by inter-individual differences in selecting cadence for different race conditions. More research is needed on high-class professional riders, since they probably represent the pinnacle of natural selection for, and physiological adaptation to, endurance exercise. Recent advances in mathematical modelling and bicycle-mounted strain gauges, which can measure power directly in races, are starting to help unravel the interrelationships between the various resistive forces on the bicycle (e.g. air and rolling resistance, gravity). Interventions on rider position to optimize aerodynamics should also consider the impact on power output-of the rider. All-terrain bicycle (ATB) racing is a neglected discipline in terms of the characterization of power outputs in race conditions and the modelling of the effects of the different design of bicycle frame, and components on the magnitude of resistive forces. A direct application of mathematical models of cycling velocity has been in identifying optimal pacing strategies for different race conditions. Such data should, nevertheless, be considered alongside physiological optimization of power output in a race. An even distribution of power output is both physiologically and biophysically optimal for longer ({\textgreater} 4 km) time-trials held in conditions of unvarying wind and gradient. For shorter races (e.g. a 1 km time-trial), an 'all out' effort from the start is advised to 'save' time during the initial phase that contributes most to total race time and to optimize the contribution of kinetic energy to race velocity. From a biophysical standpoint, the optimum pacing strategy for road time-trials may involve increasing power in headwinds and uphill sections and decreasing power in tailwinds and when travelling downhill. More research, using models and direct power measurement, is needed to elucidate fully how much such a pacing strategy might save time in a real race and how much a variable power output can be tolerated by a rider. The cyclist's diet is a multifactorial issue in itself and many researchers have tried to examine aspects of cycling nutrition (e.g. timing, amount, composition) in isolation. Only recently have researchers attempted to analyse interrelationships between dietary factors (e.g. the link between pre-race and in-race dietary effects on performance). The thermal environment is a mediating factor in choice of diet, since there may be competing interests of replacing lost fluid and depleted glycogen during and after a race. Given the prevalence of stage racing in professional cycling, more research into the influence of nutrition on repeated bouts of exercise performance and training is required.},

Walking, in all animals (as in man), involves an alternate transfer between gravitational-potential energy and kinetic energy within each stride (as takes place in a pendulum). This transfer is greatest at intermediate walking speeds and can account for up to 70{\%} of the total energy changes taking place within a stride, leaving only 30{\%} to be supplied by muscles. No kinetic-gravitational energy transfer takes place during running, hopping, and trotting, but energy is conserved by another mechanism: an elastic 'bounce' of the body. Galloping animals utilize a combination of these two energy-conserving mechanisms. During running, trotting, hopping, and galloping, 1) the power per unit weight required to maintain the forward speed of the center of mass is almost the same in all the species studied; 2) the power per unit weight required to lift the center of mass is almost independent of speed; and 3) the sum of these two powers is almost a linear function of speed.},

abstract = {Limits of agreement provide a straightforward and intuitive approach to agreement between different methods for measuring the same quantity. When pairs of observations using the two methods are independent, i.e., on different subjects, the calculations are very simple and straightforward. Some authors collect repeated data, either as repeated pairs of measurements on the same subject, whose true value of the measured quantity may be changing, or more than one measurement by one or both methods of an unchanging underlying quantity. In this paper we describe methods for analysing such clustered observations, both when the underlying quantity is assumed to be changing and when it is not.

abstract = {Athletic strength and power refer to the forces or torques generated during sporting activity. Their assessment can be used for strength diagnosis or talent identification, to monitor the effects of training interventions and to estimate the relative significance of strength and power to particular athletic pursuits. However, strength and power assessment is a difficult task. Reasons for this include: the fledgling status of research within the area, our limited understanding of the mechanisms underpinning strength and power performance and development, and limitations associated with various forms of dynamometry. This article describes a frame work for the collection of data which may ultimately lead to recommendations for the assessment of strength and power in sporting contexts. Such a framework will be evolutionary and depends upon synergistic improvements in our understanding of: the physiological mechanisms underpinning strength and power development; the effect that various training regimens have upon the development of strength and power; and factors influencing the validity and reliability of dynamometry. Currently, isometric, isoinertial and isokinetic dynamometry are employed in assessment. Each form has its supporters and detractors. Basically, proponents and critics of isokinetic and isometric dynamometry emphasise their apparently high external and apparently low internal validity respectively. While the converse applies for isoinertial dynamometry. It appears that all 3 modalities can have acceptable reliability, however this should be established rather than assumed, as the reliability of each can be threatened by a number of considerations (e.g. instruction for isometric tasks, the impact of weight used during weighted jumping tasks, and the effects of gravity and feedback on isokinetic performance). While reliability is a seminal issue in assessment, it is not the only critical issue. Specifically, there has been little research into the correlation between strength and power measures and athletic performance. This work is central to the use of such indices in talent identification. To date, this work has generally been limited to heterogeneous rather than homogeneous groups. More work is required in this area. Furthermore, not all modes of assessment are sensitive or similarly sensitive to various training interventions. This suggests that these modalities are measuring different neuromuscular qualities. How these qualities relate to performance requires more work, and will determine the contexts in which various strength and power assessment modalities and protocols are used. Following are conclusions from the review: (i) it is unlikely that one assessment procedure can be used for a multitude of ends (e.g. talent identification and monitoring the effects of training); (ii) different levels of athlete ability within a given sport may require different assessment regimens; (iii) minor changes in procedure may alter the usefulness of a procedure and (iv) we must be prepared to question assumptions pervading the field which are based upon anecdotal evidence. There are limitations with, and should be delimitations in the use of the various protocols and forms of dynamometry. {\textcopyright} 1995, Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The dynamical behavior of a musculo-skeletal link system, consisting of the right leg of a human subject, is simulated by a mathematical model which contains two control parameters for each of the five muscle groups involved. A time-optimal problem in which the right-hand end point of the state trajectory is variable is formulated and an optimization performed. The computational procedure is based on an algorithm of differential dynamic programming. The optimal model solution is then compared with the performance of the living system. It is found that any motion of the biosystem which deviates from the predicted optimal one takes a longer time to complete and is thus not optimal. Moreover, the trajectories and control functions of near-optimal motions as measured on the living system were indeed found to be very close to the theoretical optimal process thus again confirming the optimality of the model solution. In addition, the model predicts biologically highly significant phenomena such as the occurence of a stretch reflex, the incompatibility of speed and accuracy in a genetically non-determined biomotion, etc. Certain characteristic changes in the motion pattern occuring when the subject became fatigued are analyzed, and a possible explanation for this phenomenon is suggested. It is believed that this is the first time that an optimization of this kind has been performed successfully. Possible practical applications of the findings of this study are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {Humans seem to adjust their walking and running gaits to minimise the metabolic energy cost of locomotion. The walking speed that we tend to prefer is the one that minimises energy cost per unit distance, though faster speeds might seem preferable when time is valuable. At speeds up to 2 m/s, walking requires less energy than running, and we walk. At higher speeds, running is more economical, and we run. At each speed we use the stride length that minimises energy costs. A computer model that predicts metabolic rates for all conceivable gaits of a simple biped helps to understand these and other features of human gait. The energy cost of walking is increased on uphill slopes and also on soft ground. Consequently, zigzag paths should be preferred to straight ones, up hills of more than a critical gradient. Also, it may be more economical to divert a path around a hill than to travel along a straight line. Simple theories of optimum diversions are presented, both for hilly ground and for ground interrupted by marshy patches, on which costs of walking are increased. Energy costs are also increased by heavy loads, though it seems possible in some circumstances to carry moderate loads without measurable extra cost. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Energy can be saved in terrestrial locomotion in many different ways. The maximum shortening speeds (Vmax) of the muscles can be adjusted to their optimum values for the tasks required of them. The moments exerted by the muscles at different joints can be adjusted to keep the ground force in line with the leg so that muscles do not work against each other. The joints of the legs can be kept as straight as possible, minimizing muscle forces and work requirements. Walking gaits should be selected at low Froude numbers (a dimensionless speed parameter) and running gaits at high Froude numbers. Tendon and other springs can be used to store elastic strain energy and to return it by elastic recoil. This paper aims to show how these energy-saving mechanisms work and to what extent mammals exploit them. Arguments based on our rather limited knowledge of the relationship between the mechanical performance of muscle and its metabolic energy consumption are used throughout. They suggest that muscles that are optimally adapted for their tasks in running should do positive work with constant efficiency.},

The first aim is to systematically gather, summarize, evaluate and synthesize information regarding the accuracy and the value of previous research published in the literature between 2011 and 2018. The second goal is to extensively report on the holistic, experimental outcomes of this domain in relation to current research. It is systematically performed to provide a wealthy image and grounded evidence of the current state of research covering EEG-based control for assistive rehabilitation devices to all the experts and scientists.

abstract = {The musculoskeletal structure of the foot and ankle has the potential to influence human sprinting performance in complex ways. A large Achilles' tendon moment arm improves the mechanical advantage of the triceps surae but also produces larger shortening velocity during rapid plantarflexion, which detracts from the force-generating capacity of the plantarflexors. The lever arm of the ground reaction force that resists the muscular plantarflexor moment during propulsive push-off is constrained in part by the skeletal structure of the foot. In this study, we measured the plantarflexion moment arms of the Achilles' tendon, lateral gastrocnemius fascicle lengths and pennation angles, and anthropometric characteristics of the foot and lower leg in collegiate sprinters and height-matched non-sprinters. The Achilles' tendon moment arms of the sprinters were 25{\%} smaller on average in sprinters than in non-sprinters (P{\textless}0.001) whereas the sprinters' fascicles were 11{\%} longer on average (P=0.024). The ratio of fascicle length to moment arm was 50{\%} larger in sprinters (P{\textless}0.001). Sprinters were found to have longer toes (P=0.032) and shorter lower legs (P=0.026) than non sprinters. A simple computer simulation of the sprint push-off demonstrated that shorter plantarflexor moment arms and longer toes, like those measured in sprinters, permit greater generation of forward impulse. Simulated propulsion was enhanced in both cases by increasing the 'gear ratio' of the foot, thus maintaining plantarflexor fibre length and reducing peak fibre shortening velocity. Longer toes especially prolonged the time of contact, giving greater time for forward acceleration by propulsive ground reaction force.},

abstract = {This study quantified the interaction of electromyography (EMG) obtained from the vastus lateralis and metabolic energy cost of running (Cr; mL{\textperiodcentered} [mass+load]-1{\textperiodcentered} meter-1), an index of running economy, during submaximal treadmill running. Experiments were conducted with and without load on the back on a motor-driven treadmill on the downhill, level and uphill slopes. The obtained EMG was full-wave rectified and integrated (iEMG). The iEMG was divided into eccentric (ECC) and concentric (CON) phases with a foot sensor and a knee-joint goniometer. The ratio of ECC to CON (ECC/CON ratio) was regarded as the muscle elastic capacity during running on each slope. The Cr was determined as the ratio of the 2-min steady-state V̇ O2 to the running speed. We found a significant decrease in the Cr when carrying the load at all slopes. The ECC/CON ratio was significantly higher in the load condition at the downhill and level slopes, but not at the uphill slope. A significant gradient difference was observed in the Cr (down{\textless}level{\textless}up) and ECC/CON ratio (down=level{\textgreater}uphill). Thus, an alteration of Cr by the gradient and load was almost consistent with that of the ECC/CON ratio. The ECC/CON ratio, but not the rotative torque (T) functioning around the center of body mass, significantly correlated with Cr (r=-0.41, p{\textless}0.05). These results indicated that the ECC/CON ratio, rather than T, contributed to one of the energy-saving mechanisms during running with load.},

Complimentary to this, many scientists have realized the need for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices.

abstract = {Compared with quadrupeds, bipedal runners of the same weight have longer legs, take longer steps and can presumably use slower, more economical muscle fibers. One might predict that bipedal running is less expensive, but it is not. We hypothesized that bipeds recruit a larger volume of muscle to support their weight, eliminating the potential economy of longer legs and slower steps. To test our hypothesis, we calculated the relative volume of muscle needed to support body weight over a stride in small dogs (Canis familiaris) and wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) of the same weight. First, we confirmed that turkeys and dogs use approximately the same amount of energy to run at the same speed, and found that turkeys take 1.8-fold longer steps. Higher muscle forces and/or longer muscle fibers would require a greater volume of active muscle, since muscle volume is proportional to the product of force and fascicle length. We measured both mean fascicle length and mean mechanical advantage for limb extensor muscles. Turkeys generated approximately the Same total muscle force to support their weight during running and used muscle fascicles that are on average 2.1 times as long as in dogs, thus requiring a 2.5-fold greater active muscle volume. The greater volume appears to offset the economy of slower rates of force generation, supporting our hypothesis and providing a simple explanation for why it costs the same to run on two and four legs.},

abstract = {Muscle produces force by forming cross-bridges, using energy released from ATP. While the magnitude and duration of force production primarily determine the energy requirement, nearly a century ago Fenn observed that muscle shortening or lengthening influenced energetic cost of contraction. When work is done by the muscle, the energy cost is increased and when work is done on the muscle the energy cost is reduced. However, the magnitude of the 'Fenn effect' and its mirror ('negative Fenn effect') have not been quantitatively resolved. We describe a new technique coupling magnetic resonance spectroscopy with an in vivo force clamp that can directly quantify the Fenn effect [E=I+W, energy liberated (E) equals the energy cost of isometric force production (I) plus the work done (W )] and the negative Fenn effect (E=I-W ) for one muscle, the first dorsal interosseous (FDI). ATP cost was measured during a series of contractions, each of which occurred at a constant force and for a constant duration, thus constant force-time integral (FTI). In all subjects, as the FTI increased with load, there was a proportional linear increase in energy cost. In addition, the cost of producing force greatly increased when the muscle shortened, and was slightly reduced during lengthening contraction. These results, though limited to a single muscle, contraction velocity and muscle length change, do quantitatively support the Fenn effect. We speculate that they also suggest that an elastic element within the FDI muscle functions to preserve the force generated within the cross-bridges.},

abstract = {Background The effect of cadence and work rate on the joint specific power production in cycling has previously been studied, but research has primarily focused on cadences above 60 rpm, without examining the effect of low cadence on joint contribution to power. Purpose Our purpose was to investigate joint specific power production in recreational and elite cyclists during low- and moderate cycling at a range of different cadences. Methods 18 male cyclists (30.9 ± 2.7 years with a work rate in watt at lactate threshold of 282.3 ± 9.3 W) performed cycling bouts at seven different pedalling rates and three intensities. Joint specific power was calculated from kinematic measurements and pedal forces using inverse dynamics at a total of 21 different stages. Results A main effect of cadence on the relative to the total joint power for hip-, knee- and ankle joint power was found (all p {\textless} 0.05). Increasing cadence led to increasing knee joint power and decreasing hip joint power (all p {\textless} 0.05), with the exception at low cadence ({\textless}60 rpm), where there was no effect of cadence. The elite cyclists had higher relative hip joint power compared to the recreational group (p {\textless} 0.05). The hip joint power at moderate intensity with a freely chosen cadence (FCC) was lower than the hip joint power at low intensity with a low cadence ({\textless}60 rpm) (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that there is an effect of cadence on the hip- and knee joint contribution in cycling, however, the effect only occurs from 60 rpm and upward. It also demonstrates that there is a difference in joint contribution between elite- and recreational cyclists, and provide evidence for the possibility of achieving higher relative hip joint power at low intensity than moderate intensity by altering the cadence.},

abstract = {The energetic cost of generating muscular force was studied by measuring the energetic cost of carrying loads in rats, dogs, humans, and horses for loads ranging between 7 and 27{\%} of body mass.Oxygen consumption increased in direct proportion to mass supported by the muscles, i.e.VOO2,L/VOO2/mL/m = 1.01 {\{}+/-{\}} S.D. {\{}+/-{\}} 0.017, where VOO2,L is the oxygen consumption of the animal running with a load, VOO2 is the oxygen consumption at the same speed without a load, mL, is the mass of the animal plus the load, and m is the mass of the animal.Stride frequency, average number of feet on the ground over an integral number of strides, the time of contact of each foot relative to the other feet, and the average vertical acceleration during the contact phase were not measurably changed by the loads used in our experiments. From these observations we conclude that the average accelerations of the centre of mass of the animal are not changed by carrying the loads, and that muscular force developed by the animal increases in direct proportion to the load.It follows that the rate of energy utilization by muscles of an animal as it runs along the ground at any particular speed is nearly directly proportional to the force exerted by its muscles.The energetic cost of generating force over an interval of time ({\{}int{\}} F dt) increases markedly with running speed.An important consequence of the direct proportionality between increased oxygen consumption and mass of the load is that small animals expend much more energy to generate a given force at a given speed than large animals.},

abstract = {The human foot contains passive elastic tissues that have spring-like qualities, storing and returning mechanical energy and other tissues that behave as dampers, dissipating energy. Additionally the intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles have the capacity to act as dampers and motors, dissipating and generating mechanical energy. It remains unknown as to how the contribution of all passive and active tissues combine to produce the overall energetic function of the foot during running. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if the foot behaves globally as an active spring-damper during running. Fourteen participants ran on a force-instrumented treadmill at 2.2 ms-1, 3.3 ms-1 and 4.4 ms-1, while foot segment motion was collected simultaneously with kinetic measurements. A unified deformable segment model was applied to quantify the instantaneous power of the foot segment during ground contact and mechanical work was calculated by integrating the foot power data. At all running speeds, the foot absorbed energy from early stance through to mid-stance and subsequently returned/generated a proportion of this energy in late stance. The magnitude of negative work performed increased with running speed, while the magnitude of positive work remained relatively constant across all running speeds. The proportion of energy dissipated relative to that absorbed (foot dissipation-ratio) was always greater than zero and increased with running speed, suggesting that the foot behaves as a viscous spring-damper.},

Because of the improvement of the performances and the closeness of the results achieved by world class rowers, scientific investigations on rowing have become more and more important. The objectives of these investigations are first the analysis and second the improvement of the physiological performance capacity of rowers (5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30, 34). Even a superficial look at the training practice of rowers reveals gaps in the knowledge of the physiological and, more precisely, the metabolic effects of rowing exercises (1, 17). The aim of this study is therefore to analyse and classify the rowing-specific training loads on the water. During both the preparation and competition periods, several highly qualified (elite) West German rowers underwent lactate tests at different training loads on the water. The results of these tests make the determination of the real intensity of the training exercises possible.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-invasively recorded somatosensory high-frequency oscillations (sHFOs) evoked by electric nerve stimulation are markers of human cortical population spikes. Previously, their analysis was based on massive averaging of EEG responses. Advanced neurotechnology and optimized off-line analysis can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of sHFOs, eventually enabling single-trial analysis.
METHODS: The rationale for developing dedicated low-noise EEG technology for sHFOs is unfolded. Detailed recording procedures and tailored analysis principles are explained step-by-step. Source codes in Matlab and Python are provided as supplementary material online.
RESULTS: Combining synergistic hardware and analysis improvements, evoked sHFOs at around 600 Hz ('$\sigma$-bursts') can be studied in single-trials. Additionally, optimized spatial filters increase the signal-to-noise ratio of components at about 1 kHz ('$\kappa$-bursts') enabling their detection in non-invasive surface EEG.
CONCLUSIONS: sHFOs offer a unique possibility to record evoked human cortical population spikes non-invasively. The experimental approaches and algorithms presented here enable also non-specialized EEG laboratories to combine measurements of conventional low-frequency EEG with the analysis of concomitant cortical population spike responses.},

abstract = {Critical Power: An Important Fatigue Threshold in Exercise Physiology. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 48, No. 11, pp. 2320–2334, 2016. The hyperbolic form of the power– duration relationship is rigorous and highly conserved across species, forms of exercise, and individual muscles/muscle groups. For modalities such as cycling, the relationship resolves to two parameters, the asymptote for power (critical power [CP]) and the so-called W{\P} (work doable above CP), which together predict the tolerable duration of exercise above CP. Crucially, the CP concept integrates sentinel physiological profiles—respiratory, metabolic, and contractile—within a coherent framework that has great scientific and practical utility. Rather than calibrating equivalent exercise intensities relative to metabolically distant parameters such as the lactate threshold or V˙ O2max, setting the exercise intensity relative to CP unifies the profile of systemic and intramuscular responses and, if greater than CP, predicts the tolerable duration of exercise until W{\P} is expended, V˙ O2max is attained, and intolerance is manifested. CP may be regarded as a ‘‘fatigue threshold'' in the sense that it separates exercise intensity domains within which the physiological responses to exercise can (GCP) or cannot (9CP) be stabilized. The CP concept therefore enables important insights into 1) the principal loci offatigue development (central vs. peripheral) at different intensities ofexercise and 2) mechanisms ofcardiovascular and metabolic control and their modulation by factors such as O2 delivery. Practically, the CP concept has great potential application in optimizing athletic training programs and performance as well as improving the life quality for individuals enduring chronic disease.},

abstract = {Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be combined with a motorized cycle to offer various rehabilitation options for individuals with neurological conditions. Typically, FES cycling controllers use cooperating muscles and an electric motor to track cadence. In this paper, in addition to cooperative cadence tracking, the motorized cycle tracks an admittance trajectory generated using torque feedback. This method allows the cycle to deviate from the desired cadence trajectory and admit to the rider-applied torque, ensuring safe human-machine interaction. Two sets of uncertain, nonlinear dynamics are presented, one for the human rider and one for the robot, linked by a common measurable interaction torque. After developing cadence and admittance controllers, a Lyapunov-like switched system stability analysis is provided to prove global exponential tracking of the cadence error system, and a passivity analysis is conducted to prove passivity of the cycle's admittance controller with respect to the rider's interaction torque.},

abstract = {The observation that the activity of multiple muscles can be well approximated by a few linear synergies is viewed by some as a sign that such low-dimensional modules constitute a key component of the neural control system. Here, we argue that the usefulness of muscle synergies as a control principle should be evaluated in terms of errors produced not only in muscle space, but also in task space. We used data from a force-aiming task in two dimensions at the wrist, which has relatively low redundancyusing an EMG-driven virtual biomechanics technique that overcomes typical errors in predicting force from recorded EMG, to illustrate through simulation how synergy decomposition inevitably introduces substantial task space errors not present in the original data set. Then, we computed the optimal pattern of muscle activation that minimizes summed- squared muscle activities for a representation of muscle biomechanics extracted from experimental data, and demonstrated that synergy decomposition produced similar results on real and simulated data. We further assessed the influence of synergy decomposition on aiming errors in a more redundant system, using the optimal muscle pattern computed for the elbow-joint complex (i.e., 13 muscles acting in two dimensions of flexion/extension and supination/pronation). Because EMG records are typically not available from all contributing muscles, we also explored reconstructions from incomplete sets of muscles. The redundancy of a given set of muscles had opposite effects on the goodness of muscle reconstruction and on task achievement; higher redundancy is associated with better muscle EMG approximation (lower residuals), but with higher aiming errors. Finally, we showed that the number of synergies required to approximate the optimal muscle pattern for an arbitrary biomechanical system increases with task-space dimensionality, which indicates that the capacity of synergy decomposition to explain behaviour depends critically on the scope of the original database. These results have implications regarding the viability of muscle synergy as a putative neural control mechanism, and also as a control algorithm to restore movements. {\textcopyright} 2013 De{\_}rugy, Loeb and Carroll.},

abstract = {Smartphones have revolutionized the way users interact with the world and have helped pave the way for hundreds of new and exciting mobile applications. A complex array of sensors exists within smartphones, including GPS, barometer, accelerometer and other positional sensors that are leveraged by these mobile applications. These sensors are capable of providing location, speed, gradient, altitude, and acceleration data that are foundational for providing a new generation of mobile fitness applications. One such example is the development of cycling power meter applications within the sport of road biking that provides new insights into the real time power expenditure and overall cycling efficiency. This research focuses on the potential of using a smartphone and opposing force power meter (OFPM) as a replacement for traditional and expensive direct force power meters (DFPM) that have been the “de facto” standard over the last ten years. Field collected power meter cycling data, combined with spatial analysis, is used to compare various dimensions of power meter accuracy, GPS road network accuracy, elevation agreement, and cost. The overall results of this field study showed that using a smartphone power meter application performed within +/− 10{\%} on average when compared to a traditional DFPM meter, but only when the application had access to high quality location and speed data from the smartphone's GPS sensors. The results also showed that on average, the OFPM system performed within +/− 2{\%} on average when compared to the DFPM reference power meter but was challenged with data latency on quick changing terrain and accelerations. Concluding the research, a summary analysis is provided as a way for cyclist to quickly understand how well each power meter performed and to determine if a specific power meter system is better suited for a rider's individual needs.},

abstract = {Dynamic bike fitting often includes the optimisation of lower limb joint kinematics while participants undertake sub-maximal intensity cycling; however, this practice might not be appropriate for sprint cycling. This study aimed to determine if trained cyclists maintain lower limb angles, defined during dynamic sub-maximal bike fitting, while completing seated sprint cycling. Fifteen competitive cyclists completed two testing sessions. Dynamic bike fitting was undertaken during the first session, where handlebar positions were identified to produce pre-determined hip flexion angles (70°–110°) during sub-maximal cycling using an inertial-based motion tracking system. In the second session, full body kinematics were determined during two 6-s sprints performed at each of the pre-determined handlebar positions. During sprinting, measured right hip angles were only different at 110°, when compared with 90° (p {\textless} 0.01, d = 0.95), and 80° (p {\textless} 0.01, d = 1.49). For the left leg, measured hip angles differed between 110° vs. 90° (p {\textless} 0.01, d = 1.52), 110° vs. 80° (p {\textless} 0.01, d = 2.09), and 100° vs. 80° (p = 0.04, d = 1.06). Even though changes in bike configuration resulted in 10° increments of hip flexion during dynamic sub-maximal bike fitting, these hip angles were not replicated during sprinting. Therefore, dynamic sub-maximal bike fitting leading to changes in handlebar positions that produce hip angles of 80°–100° might not influence cycling performance due to acute changes in the body position of cyclists on the bicycle during a sprint.},

abstract = {Critical Power: An Important Fatigue Threshold in Exercise Physiology. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 48, No. 11, pp. 2320–2334, 2016. The hyperbolic form of the power– duration relationship is rigorous and highly conserved across species, forms of exercise, and individual muscles/muscle groups. For modalities such as cycling, the relationship resolves to two parameters, the asymptote for power (critical power [CP]) and the so-called W{\P} (work doable above CP), which together predict the tolerable duration of exercise above CP. Crucially, the CP concept integrates sentinel physiological profiles—respiratory, metabolic, and contractile—within a coherent framework that has great scientific and practical utility. Rather than calibrating equivalent exercise intensities relative to metabolically distant parameters such as the lactate threshold or V˙ O2max, setting the exercise intensity relative to CP unifies the profile of systemic and intramuscular responses and, if greater than CP, predicts the tolerable duration of exercise until W{\P} is expended, V˙ O2max is attained, and intolerance is manifested. CP may be regarded as a ‘‘fatigue threshold'' in the sense that it separates exercise intensity domains within which the physiological responses to exercise can (GCP) or cannot (9CP) be stabilized. The CP concept therefore enables important insights into 1) the principal loci offatigue development (central vs. peripheral) at different intensities ofexercise and 2) mechanisms ofcardiovascular and metabolic control and their modulation by factors such as O2 delivery. Practically, the CP concept has great potential application in optimizing athletic training programs and performance as well as improving the life quality for individuals enduring chronic disease.},

The reciprocal nature of stationary cycling also makes it a viable model for research in motor control because the body is supported by the saddle allowing the researcher to focus on the cyclic movement of the legs without the confounding variable of balance. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the cycling task in intact cyclists and relate this information to understanding the challenges faced by cyclists with transtibial amputations (CTA). Ongoing research into the biomechanics of CTAs will be summarized to expose the differences between intact and CTA cycling mechanics, asymmetries between limbs of CTAs as well as neuromuscular adaptation following amputation.

abstract = {Athlete-tracking devices that include global positioning system (GPS) and microelectrical mechanical system (MEMS) components are now commonplace in sport research and practice. These devices provide large amounts of data that are used to inform decision making on athlete training and performance. However, the data obtained from these devices are often provided without clear explanation of how these metrics are obtained. At present, there is no clear consensus regarding how these data should be handled and reported in a sport context. Therefore, the aim of this review was to examine the factors that affect the data produced by these athlete-tracking devices and to provide guidelines for collecting, processing, and reporting of data. Many factors including device sampling rate, positioning and fitting of devices, satellite signal, and data-filtering methods can affect the measures obtained from GPS and MEMS devices. Therefore researchers are encouraged to report device brand/model, sampling frequency, number of satellites, horizontal dilution of precision, and software/firmware versions in any published research. In addition, details of inclusion/exclusion criteria for data obtained from these devices are also recommended. Considerations for the application of speed zones to evaluate the magnitude and distribution of different locomotor activities recorded by GPS are also presented, alongside recommendations for both industry practice and future research directions. Through a standard approach to data collection and procedure reporting, researchers and practitioners will be able to make more confident comparisons from their data, which will improve the understanding and impact these devices can have on athlete performance.},

abstract = {The motor unit is composed of the motoneuron, its axon branching within a muscle, and the innervated muscle fibers. There are three types of motor units: slow (S), fast resistant to fatigue (FR), and fast fatigable (FF). Differences between them concern morphological and electrophysiological properties of motoneurons, a number, morphology, biochemical characteristics, and metabolism of muscle fibers forming each unit, contractile times, forces and fatigue resistance. Recruitment of motor units into a contraction depends on the excitability of motoneurons and correlates with the properties of muscle fibers. The number of active units, their position and mutual relations within a muscle as well as frequencies and patterns of discharges generated by motoneurons determine the muscle force during subsequent phases of movement. The properties of motoneurons and motor units are subject to plastic modifications during development and aging, as a result of various forms of motor activity or disease. The motor unit activity is closely connected to the muscle receptors, primarily muscle spindles, and tendon organs which send information about the spatial position of the body and the limbs to the central nervous system, thus contributing to the control of precise movements.},

abstract = {Many mechanisms reduce the cost of muscle activity. Here, we describe a set of specializations that reduce the cost of contraction in the high-frequency twitches that are used by a wide variety of animals for either sound production or flight. Minimizing the cost of these contractions means that cellular ATP production can meet ATP demand and sustain the high contractile rate. Two classes of specialization are found that minimize the contractile cost. The first class reduces the muscle work required per contraction. Light appendages such as rattles, insect limbs and membranous wings that require little work for movement are used in high-frequency contractions. The second set of specializations involves processes that minimize energy use. High-frequency muscles tend to have a lower cross-bridge content, fewer attached cross-bridges and shorter length changes per contraction. The result is low muscle-specific forces (stress), small length changes (strain) and rapid contraction times that suggest that these muscles push the lower limit of contractile function. The consequence of function at this lower extreme of contraction is to minimize the contractile cost of high-frequency muscles. Thus, specializations that permit rapid contractions at a low rate of ATP use per twitch are the basis of a minimization strategy for energy saving in muscles contracting at high frequency.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Background: Humans normally dissipate significant energy during walking, largely at the transitions between steps. The ankle then acts to restore energy during push-off, which may be the reason that ankle impairment nearly always leads to poorer walking economy. The replacement of lost energy is necessary for steady gait, in which mechanical energy is constant on average, external dissipation is negligible, and no net work is performed over a stride. However, dissipation and replacement by muscles might not be necessary if energy were instead captured and reused by an assistive device. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a microprocessor-controlled artificial foot that captures some of the energy that is normally dissipated by the leg and "recycles" it as positive ankle work. In tests on subjects walking with an artificially-impaired ankle, a conventional prosthesis reduced ankle push-off work and increased net metabolic energy expenditure by 23{\%} compared to normal walking. Energy recycling restored ankle push-off to normal and reduced the net metabolic energy penalty to 14{\%}. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that reduced ankle push-off contributes to the increased metabolic energy expenditure accompanying ankle impairments, and demonstrate that energy recycling can be used to reduce such cost. {\textcopyright} 2010 Collins, Kuo.},

abstract = {Stroke leads to severe mobility impairments for millions of individuals each year. Functional outcomes can be improved through manual treadmill therapy, but high costs limit patient exposure and, thereby, outcomes. Robotic gait training could increase the viable duration and frequency of training sessions, but robotic approaches employed thus far have been less effective than manual therapy. These shortcomings may relate to subconscious energy-minimizing drives, which might cause patients to engage less actively in therapy when provided with corrective robotic assistance. We have devised a new method for gait rehabilitation that harnesses, rather than fights, least-effort tendencies. Therapeutic goals, such as increased use of the paretic limb, are made easier than the patient's nominal gait through selective assistance from a robotic platform. We performed a pilot test on a healthy subject (N = 1) in which altered self-selected stride length was induced using a tethered robotic ankle-foot orthosis. The subject first walked on a treadmill while wearing the orthosis with and without assistance at unaltered and voluntarily altered stride length. Voluntarily increasing stride length by 5{\%} increased metabolic energy cost by 4{\%}. Robotic assistance decreased energy cost at both unaltered and voluntarily increased stride lengths, by 6{\%} and 8{\%} respectively. We then performed a test in which the robotic system continually monitored stride length and provided more assistance if the subject's stride length approached a target increase. This adaptive assistance protocol caused the subject to slowly adjust their gait patterns towards the target, leading to a 4{\%} increase in stride length. Metabolic energy consumption was simultaneously reduced by 5{\%}. These results suggest that selective-assistance protocols based on targets relevant to rehabilitation might lead patients to self-select desirable gait patterns during robotic gait training sessions, possibly facilitating better adherence and outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans are very well-tuned for locomotion. Metabolic energy used during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton, but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without providing an additional energy source? This would require an improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 ± 2.6{\%} for healthy human users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this seemingly simple behaviour.},

Transport of the fatty acids across the plasma membrane is mostly mediated by proteins called fatty acid transporters. Contractile activity increases plasma membrane expression of the transporters and transmembrane transport of the fatty acids. Upon entering the cell the acids are either directed to mitochondria for oxidation or incorporated into the complex lipids, mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs). The complex lipids belong to the class of glycerolipids and sphingolipids. TAGs are stored in lipid droplets. The first, rate-limiting step of TAG hydrolysis is catalyzed by adipose triglyceride lipase. Activity of the enzyme is up-regulated by a protein called comparative gene identification-58 and down-regulated by G0/G1 switch protein 2. The major bioactive sphingolipids are ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate. Exercise affects the metabolism of most muscle lipids.},

abstract = {Assessment of cardiac energetics at the level of ATP-synthesis, chemomechanical energy transformation and whole organ dynamics as a function of haemodynamic load, ventricular configuration and oxygen- and substrates supply is basic to understanding cardiac function under physiological and pathophysiological (hypertrophy, hypoxia, ischaemia and heart failure) conditions. Moreover, cardiac energetics should be an important consideration in the choice and application of drugs especially in the case of vasodilators, inotropic agents and in cardioprotective measures. Only by considering energetics at the subcellular, cellular, and whole-heart level we can arrive at a better understanding of cardiac performance and ultimately better clinical judgement and drug therapy. Quantification of myocardial energetics will also help to determine the optimal time for surgical interventions such as valvular replacement or aneurysm resection. The present volume is the outcome of an international symposium on cardiac energetics held in Gargellen/Montafon (Austria), June 1986. The contributions will certainly help bridge the existing gap between basic research involving isolated structures and that involving the whole organ, on the one hand, and render the results derived from basic research applicable to clinical problems, on the other hand.},

abstract = {A 3D cycling model has been developed that combines bicycle mechanics, rider biomechanics and environmental factors into a single dynamic system. The aim of the model is to identify me- chanical mechanisms that influence performance in a road cycling time trial with simulations representing real cyclists competing over an actual course. The model is constructed using the Matlab toolbox SimMechanics to model physical entities and Simulink to model control structures. The system is actuated by force or motion actuators applied to joints or bodies with sensors measuring the resulting forces and motion. SimMechan- ics automatically derives the equations of motion leaving the developer free to concentrate on defining the mechanics of the system. Initial conditions are specified and a variable step ODE solver numerically integrates solutions that meet defined tolerances. Initial validation compared model simulations with data reported in the literature. Rider-less self-stability after a perturbation was found to compare well with previous work. Weave eigen- values became negative at 4.2 m/s and capsize eigenvalues became almost positive at 6.1 m/s. Crank torque over a cycle at 255 W was recorded from the model and found to correlate well (R2=0.97) with previously published experimental data. Finally, the tyre model generated tyre cornering stiffness of 62N/degree which closely matched the 60 N/degree reported by a previ- ous investigation. Experimental field validation compared actual and model predicted time taken by 14 experi- enced cyclists to complete a time trial over an undulating 2.5 mile road course. The course was digitised and loaded into the model and the model parameterised with individual mass and aero- dynamic characteristics. Wind strength and direction were also measured. An error level of 1.4{\%} (±1.5{\%}) was found between actual and predicted time. This compares well with the aver- age 1.32{\%} error reported by existing road cycling models over less complex courses},

A sport-scientific approach that clearly schedules exercise type, exercise parameters, and exercise principles and adequately considers basic principles of bone metabolism and fall risk might be the most promising strategy to address fracture risk in older adults. Apart from sport science and medicine, however it is essential to implement the program in an attractive social setting that enables a regular, individualized and effective, but also safe and joyous, exercise training to facilitate subjects' adherence to this persistent overall prevention strategy.},

abstract = {Introduction: The purpose of this study was to provide support, based on a review of existing data, for a general relationship between metabolic cost and force generated. There are confounding factors that can affect metabolic cost, including muscle contraction type (isometric, eccentric, or concentric), length, and speed as well as fiber type (e.g., fast or slow) and moment arm distances. Despite these factors, empirical relationships for metabolic cost have been found that transcend species and movements. Methods: We revisited the various equations that have been proposed to relate metabolic rate with mass, velocity, and step contact time during running and found that metabolic rate was proportional to the external force generated and the number of steps per unit time. This relationship was in agreement with a previously proposed hypothesis that the metabolic cost to generate a single application of a unit external force is a constant. Results: Data from the literature were collected for a number of different activities and species to support the hypothesis. Running quadrupedal and bipedal species, as well as human cycling, cross-country skiing, running (forward, backward, on an incline, and against a horizontal force), and arm activities (running, cycling, and ski poling), all had a constant metabolic cost per unit external force per application. Conclusion: The proportionality constant varied with activity, possibly reflecting differences in the aspects of muscular contraction, fiber types, or mechanical advantage in each activity. It is speculated that a more general relation could be obtained if biomechanical analyses to account for other factors, such as contraction length, were included.},

However, too little or too much stiffness is believed to increase the risk of musculoskeletal injury. Purpose. To provide a current update of the lower extremity stiffness literature as it pertains to both performance and injury. Summary. It appears that increased stiffness is beneficial to performance. As well it appears that there may be an optimal amount of stiffness that allows for injury-free performance. There is some evidence that increased stiffness may be related to bony injuries and decreased stiffness may be associated with soft tissue injuries. Further investigations should evaluate the relationship between stiffness and injury prospectively.

abstract = {Leg swing in human walking has historically been viewed as a passive motion with little metabolic cost. Recent estimates of leg swing costs are equivocal, covering a range from 10 to 33 per cent of the net cost of walking. There has also been a debate as to whether the periods of double-limb support during the stance phase dominate the cost of walking. Part of this uncertainty is because of our inability to measure metabolic energy consumption in individual muscles during locomotion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the metabolic cost of walking using a modelling approach that allowed instantaneous energy consumption rates in individual muscles to be estimated over the full gait cycle. At a typical walking speed and stride rate, leg swing represented 29 per cent of the total muscular cost. During the stance phase, the double-limb and single-limb support periods accounted for 27 and 44 per cent of the total cost, respectively. Performing step-to-step transitions, which encompasses more than just the double-support periods, represented 37 per cent of the total cost of walking. Increasing stride rate at a constant speed led to greater double-limb support costs, lower swing phase costs and no change in single-limb support costs. Together, these results provide unique insight as to how metabolic energy is expended over the human gait cycle. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Purpose: Exercise economy is not solely an intrinsic physiological trait because economy in one mode of exercise (e.g., running) does not strongly correlate with economy in another mode (e.g. cycling). Economy also reflects the skill of an individual in a particular mode of exercise. Arguably, level, uphill and downhill running constitute biomechanically different modes of exercise. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that level running economy (LRE), uphill running economy (URE) and downhill running economy (DRE) would not be strongly inter-correlated. Methods: We measured the oxygen uptakes of 19 male trained runners during three different treadmill running speed and grade conditions: 238 m/min, 0{\%}; 167 m/min, + 7.5{\%}; 291 m/min, − 5{\%}. Mean oxygen uptakes were 46.8 (SD 3.9), 48.0 (3.4) and 46.9 (3.7) ml/kg/min for level, uphill and downhill running, respectively, indicating that the three conditions were of similar aerobic intensity. Results: We reject our hypothesis based on the strong correlations of r = 0.909, r = 0.901 and r = 0.830, respectively, between LRE vs. URE, LRE vs. DRE and URE vs. DRE. Conclusion: Economical runners on level surfaces are also economical on uphill and downhill grades. Inter-individual differences in running economy reflect differences in both intrinsic physiology and skill. Individuals who have experience with level, uphill and downhill running appear to be equally skilled in all three modes.},

abstract = {Aerodynamic and rolling resistances are the two major resistances that affect road cyclists on level ground. Because of reduced speeds and markedly different tyre-ground interactions, rolling resistance could be more influential in mountain biking than road cycling. The aims of this study were to quantify 1) aerodynamic resistance of mountain-bike cyclists in the seated position and 2) rolling resistances of two types of mountain-bike tyre (smooth and knobby) in three field surfaces (road, sand and grass) with two pressure inflations (200 and 400 kPa). Mountain-bike cyclists have an effective frontal area (product of projected frontal area and drag coefficient) of 0.357 ± 0.023 m2, with the mean aerodynamic resistance representing 8-35{\%} of the total resistance to cyclists' motion depending on the magnitude of the rolling resistance. The smooth tyre had 21 ± 15{\%} less rolling resistance than the knobby tyre. Field surface and inflation pressure also affected rolling resistance. These results indicate that aerodynamic resistance influences mountain-biking performance, even with lower speeds than road cycling. Rolling resistance is increased in mountain biking by factors such as tyre type, surface condition and inflation pressure that may also alter performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Thus, most sexually dimorphic traits can be directly linked to the reproductive role of each sex. Sexual dimorphism in trophic structures (e.g. beak, jaws, teeth), however, often lacks a direct link to reproduction. 2. Trophic structures can be linked indirectly to reproductive allocation via energy acquisition. The reproductive role hypothesis (also known as the dimorphic niche hypothesis) posits such an indirect link, but has received heretofore little direct empirical support. We tested this hypothesis in a molluscivorous turtle exhibiting marked female-biased trophic morphology dimorphism. 3. Bite force analysis showed that females have stronger jaws than males and dietary analysis revealed that females ingest snails closer to their maximum biting capacity than males. Body condition of both sexes and reproductive output of females increased with relative head width, indicating that fitness is tightly linked to head size and bite force. 4. Our study provides strong evidence that reproductive role contributes to sexual dimorphism in trophic morphology. Our findings should apply to any animal in which energy intake is limited by trophic morphology.},

abstract = {The resistance against a cyclist while riding on rollers is due mainly to rolling resistance produced by the deformation of the tyre as it rolls against small diameter drums. Resistance is then combined with wheel speed to set power output. The effect of tyre pressure and cross‐section on power was investigated by systematically altering the pressure (552 kPa, 690 kPa, and 827 kPa) in a 20c, 23c, 25c, and 28c tyre of the same design while riding at a wheel speed of 45 kph. Average power over 1 minute was measured with a Power Tap Hub (Tune Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) on five occasions. Statistical significance was evaluated at p {\textless} 0.05. Power requirements increased significantly with each reduction in tyre pressure for all tyres and pressures except the 25c between 690 and 827 kPa. The 20c tyre required significantly more power from the cyclist at each tested tyre pressure when compared to the other tyres (which were not different from each other). The differences in resistance from tyre size were not observed when ridden on the road. Additionally, a slightly different tyre design from the same manufacturer responded similarly in the 20c, but was significantly different in the 23c size. It was also observed that power requirements increased significantly when both the wheels were ridden on the rollers as compared to just the rear wheel. These results indicate that the power requirements may be significantly altered by the cyclist by adjusting tyre pressure, tyre cross‐section size, tyre type, and with the number of wheels contacting the rollers. However, the magnitude of these power requirements may not be suitable for intense workouts of trained cyclists. {\textcopyright} 2003 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new method of measuring rolling resistance in treadmill cycling and to establish its sensitivity and reproducibility. One participant was asked to keep a bicycle in equilibrium on a treadmill without pedalling at a constant speed of 5.56 m s71, which was held in place in the front by a dynamometer. For each condition, the method consisted of 11 measurements of the force required to hold the cycle at different treadmill slopes (0-10{\%}, increment 1{\%}). The coefficient of rolling resistance was calculated based on the forces applied to the bicycle in equilibrium. To test the sensitivity of the method, the bicycle was successively equipped with three tyre types (700 628, 700 623, 700 622) and inflation pressure was set at 150, 300, 600, 900, and 1100 kPa. To test the reproducibility of the method, a second experimenter repeated all measurements done with the 700 623 tyres. The method was sensitive enough to detect an effect of both tyre type and inflation pressure (P 50.001: two-way ANOVA). The measurement of the coefficient of rolling resistance by two separate experimenters resulted in a small bias of 0.00029 (95{\%} CI, 70.00011 to 0.00068). In conclusion, the new method is sensitive and reliable, as well as being simple and affordable.},

Therefore, in this chapter we present human body composition by taking advantage of widely accepted models, from the simplest 2-compartment model, which allows fat and fat-free body mass to be distinguished, up to a more complex, 6-compartment model, capable of distinguishing body fat, total body water, bone minerals, proteins, soft-tissue minerals, and glycogen. Moreover, in this chapter we provide equations that can be applied in laboratory and clinical practice to predict the main components of body composition, such as body water, skeletal muscles (SMs), body fat, and bone minerals. Special attention is given to the methods of evaluation of SM mass and its importance in health and disease.},

In the current study, the planar spiral spring is applied to attain the compact design of the cycling augmented knee exoskeleton (CAKE-2). The surface electromyography (EMG) results over the rectus femoris muscles of three healthy male participants performing constant power cycling on a trainer at 200 W and 225 W are analyzed in time-frequency via the continuous wavelet transform. In all cycling tests with and without the exoskeletons worn on both legs, no sign of peripheral muscle fatigue or significant change in the EMG median power spectral frequency (MDF) appears throughout the two-minute cycling trials. At the same cycling speed and leg cadence, the average of EMG-MDF increases with the exercise intensity. At the same cycling power, less quadriceps activity can be observed from all the participants when the spring support was used during cycling. The capability to modify the unbalanced effort required from the quadriceps and the hamstring during cycling without requiring an external energy source is applicable for cycling enhancement and rehabilitation applications.},

abstract = {This chapter is devoted to the regulation of intramuscular lipid metabolism. The skeletal myocytes do not synthetize fatty acids so that they must be taken up from plasma. Transport of the fatty acids across the plasma membrane is mostly mediated by proteins called fatty acid transporters. Contractile activity increases plasma membrane expression of the transporters and transmembrane transport of the fatty acids. Upon entering the cell the acids are either directed to mitochondria for oxidation or incorporated into the complex lipids, mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs). The complex lipids belong to the class of glycerolipids and sphingolipids. TAGs are stored in lipid droplets. The first, rate-limiting step of TAG hydrolysis is catalyzed by adipose triglyceride lipase. Activity of the enzyme is up-regulated by a protein called comparative gene identification-58 and down-regulated by G0/G1 switch protein 2. The major bioactive sphingolipids are ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate. Exercise affects the metabolism of most muscle lipids.},

abstract = {-A simulation based on a forward dynamical musculoskeletal model was computed from an optimal control algorithm to understand uni-and bi-articular muscle coordination of maximum-speed startup pedaling. The muscle excitations. pedal reaction forces, and crank and pedal kinematics of the simulation agreed with measurements from subjects. Over the crank cycle, uniarticular hip and knee extensor muscles provide 55{\%} of the propulsive energy, even though 27{\%} of the amount they produce in the downstroke is absorbed in the upstroke. Only 44{\%} of the energy produced by these muscles during downstroke is delivered to the crank directly. The other 56{\%} is delivered to the limb segments. and then transferred to the crank by the ankle plantarflexors. The plantarflexors, especially soleus, also prevent knee hyperextension, by slowing the knee extension being produced during downstroke by the other muscles. including hamstrings. Hamstrings and rectus femoris make smooth pedaling possible by propelling the crank through the stroke transitions. Other simulations showed that pedaling can be performed well by partitioning all the muscles in a leg into two pairs of phase-controlled alternating functional groups, with each group also alternating with its contralateral counterpart. In this scheme, the uniarticular hip/knee extensor muscles (one group) are excited during downstroke, and the uniarticular hip/knee flexor muscles (the alternating group) during upstorke. The ankle dorsiflexor and rectus femoris muscles (one group of the other pair) are excited near the transition from upstroke to downstroke. and the ankle plantarflexors and hamstrings muscles (the alternating group) during the downstroke to upstroke transition, We conclude that these alternating functional muscle groups might represent a centrally generated primitive for not only pedaling but also other locomotor tasks as well.},

This review paper describes current lower limb robotic exoskeletons,withspecific regardtocommontrends inthe field. The preponderance of published literature lacks rigorous quanti- tative evaluations of exoskeleton performance, making it difficult to determine the disadvantages and drawbacks of many of the devices. We analyzed common approaches in exoskeleton design and the convergence, or lack thereof, with certain technologies. We focused on actuators, sensors, energy sources, materials, and control strategies. One of the largest hurdles to be overcome in exoskeleton research is the user interface and control. More intuitive and flexible user interfaces are needed to increase the success of robotic exoskeletons. In the last section, we discuss promising future solutions to the major hurdles in exoskeleton control. A number of emerging technologies could deliver sub- stantial advantages to existing and future exoskeleton designs. We conclude with a listing of the advantages and disadvantages of the emerging technologies and discuss possible futures for the field},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are emerging as biomarkers of epileptogenicity. They have been shown to originate from small brain regions. Surprisingly, spontaneous HFOs can be recorded from the scalp. To understand how is it possible to observe these small events on the scalp, one avenue is the analysis of the cortical correlates at the time of scalp HFOs. Using simultaneous scalp and intracranial recordings of 11 patients, we studied the spatial distribution of scalp events on the cortical surface. For typical interictal epileptiform discharges the subdural distributions were, as expected, spatially extended. On the contrary, for scalp HFOs the subdural maps corresponded to focal sources, consisting of one or a few small spatial extent activations. These topographies suggest that small cortical areas generated the HFOs seen on the scalp. Similar scalp distributions corresponded to distinct distributions on a standard 1 cm subdural grid and averaging similar scalp HFOs resulted in focal subdural maps. The assumption that a subdural grid "sees" everything that contributes to the potential of nearby scalp contacts was not valid for HFOs. The results suggest that these small extent events are spatially undersampled with standard scalp and grid inter-electrode distances. High-density scalp electrode distributions seem necessary to obtain a solid sampling of HFOs on the scalp. A better understanding of the influence of spatial sampling on the observation of high frequency brain activity on the scalp is important for their clinical use as biomarkers of epilepsy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.},

abstract = {Muscles coordinate multijoint motion by generating forces that cause reaction forces throughout the body. Thus, a muscle can redistribute existing segmental energy by accelerating some segments and decelerating others. In the process, a muscle may also produce or absorb energy, in which case its summed energetic effect on the segments is positive or negative, respectively. This Borelli Lecture shows how dynamical simulations derived from musculoskeletal models reveal muscle-induced segmental energy redistribution and muscle co-functions and synergies. Synergy occurs when co-excited muscles distribute segmental energy differently to execute the motor task. In maximum height jumping, high vertical velocity at lift-off occurs desirably at full body extension because biarticular leg muscles redistribute the energy produced by the uniarticular leg muscles. In pedaling, synergistic ankle plantarflexor force generation during leg extension allows the high energy produced by the uniarticular hip and knee extensors to be delivered to the crank. An analogous less-powerful flexor synergy exists during leg flexion. Hamstrings reduce crank deceleration during the leg extension-to-flexion transition by not only producing energy but delivering it to the crank through its contribution to the tangential (accelerating) crank force, though this hamstrings function occurs at the opposite (flexion-extension) transition when pedaling backwards. In walking, the eccentric quadriceps activity in early stance not only decelerates the leg but also accelerates the trunk. In mid-stance, the uni- and biarticular plantarflexors, by having opposite segmental energetic effects, act in synergy to support the whole body, so segmental potential and kinetic energy exchange can occur. To conclude, the extraction of unmeasurable variables from dynamical simulations emulating task kinematics, kinetics, and EMGs shows how the production of force and energy by individual muscles contribute to the energy flow among the individual segments during task execution.},

abstract = {Asymmetries of the rowing stroke cycle have been assessed with reference to kinematics and foot-force measures in laboratory testing environments. It remains unclear how asymmetries in propulsive kinetic measures are related to on-water rowing performance. A new approach for the evaluation of both global and local asymmetries across the entire movement was used to assess the continuous role of asymmetries and whether these change according to the level of competitive representation. Twenty-seven highly skilled female rowers (national and international competition level), rowing at 32 strokes per minute in a single scull boat, were evaluated. A symmetry index (SI) and functional data analysis (FDA) techniques were applied to a continuous difference time-series, which described fluctuating asymmetry in propulsive pin forces for each rower. Univariate ANOVAs revealed that differences in asymmetries were present as a factor of competition level for the SI and results of FDA. International athletes were more likely to utilize an asymmetry strategy with increased stroke-side (port-side) force early in the drive phase and increased bow-side (starboard) force through the second half of the drive. This was likely the result of international performers customizing their movement strategies relative to known boat mechanical offsets. The first half of the drive phase was also found to be an adaptive part of the rowing stroke cycle, suggesting asymmetries may have a functional role in successful execution of movements during the rowing stroke.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Alcohol (ethanol) and resistance exercise can independently affect circulating bioavailable testosterone concentration. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the testosterone bioavailability and the anabolic endocrine milieu in response to acute ethanol ingestion after a bout of heavy resistance exercise. METHODS: Eight resistance-trained men (mean ± SD: 25.3 ± 3.2 yr, 87.7 ± 15.1 kg, 177 ± 7 cm) completed two identical acute heavy resistance exercise tests (AHRET: six sets of 10 repetitions of Smith machine squats) separated by 1 wk. Post-AHRET, participants consumed either 1.09 g of grain ethanol per kilogram lean mass (EtOH condition) or no ethanol (placebo condition). Blood samples were collected immediately before exercise (PRE), immediately after exercise (IP), and every 20 min postexercise for 300 min. Samples after IP were pooled into phases (20-40 min, 60-120 min, and 140-300 min after exercise) and analyzed for total testosterone (TT) and free testosterone (FT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), cortisol, and estradiol. RESULTS: Peak blood ethanol concentration (0.088 ± 0.015 g{\textperiodcentered}dL) was achieved 60-90 min postexercise. TT and FT were elevated significantly (P ≤ 0.05) at IP for both conditions. At 140-300 min postexercise, TT, FT, and free androgen index were significantly higher for EtOH (TT: 22.5 ± 12.5 nmol{\textperiodcentered}L; FT: 40.5 ± 7.6 pmol{\textperiodcentered}L) than for placebo (TT: 13.9 ± 6.8 nmol{\textperiodcentered}L; FT: 22.7 ± 10.0 pmol{\textperiodcentered}L). No differences between conditions were noted for SHBG, cortisol, or estradiol. CONCLUSION: Postexercise ethanol ingestion affects the hormonal milieu including testosterone concentration and bioavailability during recovery from resistance exercise.

abstract = {The effect of the non-conducting substrate of a subdural grid on the scalp electric potential distribution is studied through simulations. Using a detailed head model and the finite element method we show that the governing physics equations predict an important attenuation in the scalp potential for generators located under the grid, and an amplification for generators located under holes in the skull filled with conductive media. These effects are spatially localized and do not cancel each other. A 4×8cm grid can produce attenuations of 2 to 3 times, and an 8×8cm grid attenuation of up to 8 times. As a consequence, when there is no subdural grid, generators of 4 to 8cm 2 produce scalp potentials of the same maximum amplitude as generators of 10 to 20cm 2 under the center of a subdural grid. This means that the minimum cortical extents necessary to produce visible scalp activity determined from simultaneous scalp and subdural recordings can be overestimations.},

abstract = {The ordinary differential equations for musculoskeletal dynamics are often numerically stiff and highly nonlinear. Consequently, simulations require small time steps, and optimal control problems are slow to solve and have poor convergence. In this paper, we present an implicit formulation of musculoskeletal dynamics, which leads to new numerical methods for simulation and optimal control, with the expectation that we can mitigate some of these problems. A first order Rosenbrock method was developed for solving forward dynamic problems using the implicit formulation. It was used to perform real-time dynamic simulation of a complex shoulder arm system with extreme dynamic stiffness. Simulations had an RMS error of only 0.11 degrees in joint angles when running at real-time speed. For optimal control of musculoskeletal systems, a direct collocation method was developed for implicitly formulated models. The method was applied to predict gait with a prosthetic foot and ankle. Solutions were obtained in well under one hour of computation time and demonstrated how patients may adapt their gait to compensate for limitations of a specific prosthetic limb design. The optimal control method was also applied to a state estimation problem in sports biomechanics, where forces during skiing were estimated from noisy and incomplete kinematic data. Using a full musculoskeletal dynamics model for state estimation had the additional advantage that forward dynamic simulations, could be done with the same implicitly formulated model to simulate injuries and perturbation responses. While these methods are powerful and allow solution of previously intractable problems, there are still considerable numerical challenges, especially related to the convergence of gradient-based solvers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The energy cost of walking a given distance at a steady state has been found to reach a minimum value at an optimum speed, which, for walking on the level is about 4 km/h. For a wide range of speed values around this, the energy cost of walking does not change sensibly: only at a very high or very low speed of walking does it increase appreciably (Fig. 1). Walking uphill, the energy cost per km increases, while walking downhill a minimal energy requirement is met at an incline of about --9{\~{}}o, to increase again on steeper ground. Efficiency of Walking and Running When the efficiency of walking is calculated by considering as mechan-ical work, only the final energy change, which, when walking at a constant speed, is given only by the body lift, and neglecting the rapid energy changes taking place within a step, a value of 0 is obviously found walking on the level: it tends to a value of 0.25, walking uphill, and to a value of about --1.2 walking downhill (see Fig. 2). This last value is meant as the ratio of the mechanical work performed to the energy expenditure (chemical) by the muscle, which only improperly can be referred to as "efficiency". When walking on the level the body is subjected to kinetic and potential energy changes, but since the energy changes in one direction (positive work performance) are met with energy changes in the opposite direction (negative work) within the step, the overall energy level does not change: in other words, positive work is performed which is followed by an equivalent amount of negative work. When walking uphill the negative work performed decreases pro-gressively with increasing incline, and positive work is in excess, which},

Margaria11 Istituto di Fisiologia Umana, University of Milano, Milano, ItalyAbstractFrom records obtained from a triple accelerometer applied to the trunk of a subject the displacements of the trunk in vertical, forward, and lateral directions have been calculated. With motion pictures taken simultaneously, displacements of the center of gravity within the body were measured. From these data the external mechanical work of walking was calculated. The sum of work for vertical and for forward displacements of the center of gravity of the body gives the total external work; energy for the lateral displacements was negligible. Total external work appears to be lower than that calculated from the vertical displacements alone, because work done in lifting is partly sustained by the inertial force of the forward-moving body. Total external work reaches a highest value (0.1 kcal/km kg) at the most economical speed of walking, 4 km/hr, which corresponds to an energy consumption of 0.48 kcal/km kg. At this speed the internal work appears negligible; it amounts to appreciable entities at very low speeds because of the static contractions of the muscles, and at high speeds because of considerable stiffening of the limbs and movements not involving a displacement of the center of gravity.$\backslash$nSubmitted on May 25, 1962Copyright {\textcopyright} 1963 the American Physiological Society},

abstract = {Measurements of human power need to be interpreted in relation to the movement frequency, since that will determine the velocity of contraction of the active muscle and hence the power available according to the power-velocity relationship. Techniques are described which enable movement frequency to be kept constant during human exercise under different conditions. Combined with microdissection and analysis of muscle fibre fragments from needle biopsies obtained pre- and postexercise we have been able 'to take the muscle apart', having measured the power output, including the effect of fatigue, under conditions of constant movement frequency. We have shown that fatigue may be the consequence of a metabolic challenge to a relatively small population of fast fatigue-sensitive fibres, as indicated by [ATP] depletion to approximately 30{\%} of resting values in those fibres expressing myosin heavy chain isoform IIX after just 10 s of maximal dynamic exercise. Since these same fibres will have a high maximal velocity of contraction, they also make a disproportionate contribution to power output in relation to their number, especially at faster movement rates. The microdissection technique can also be used to measure phosphocreatine concentration ([PCr]), which is an exquisitely sensitive indicator of muscle fibre activity; thus, in just seven brief maximal contractions [PCr] is depleted to levels {\textless} 50{\%} of rest in all muscle fibre types. The technique has been applied to study exercise at different intensities, and to compare recruitment in lengthening, shortening and isometric contractions, thus yielding new information on patterns of recruitment, energy turnover and efficiency.},

Different from walking, in running the work due to the forward speed changes (variation of kinetic energy) and to the vertical displacement of the center of gravity (variation of potential energy), throughout the step cycle, are substantially in phase. The external work performed per kilometer is independent of speed, amounting to 0.25 kcal/kg km. The total mechanical work amounts to about 0.40–0.50 kcal/kg km. The efficiency in running has been calculated as about 40–50{\%}: such a high value involves a contribution of a substantial amount of energy delivered at a very low cost; this appears to be identified as elastic recoil energy from the stretched contracted muscle and amounts to about half the energy spent in running.

abstract = {This study was designed to determine how changes in oxygen uptake (VO2) and heart rate (HR) during submaximal cycle ergometry were determined by changes in cycle geometry and/or lower-limb kinematics. Fourteen trained cyclists (Mean (SD): age, 25.5 (6.4) years; body mass 74.4 (8.8) kg; peak VO2, 4.76 (0.79) 1.min-1 peak) were tested at three seat-tube angles (70 degrees, 80 degrees, 90 degrees) at each of three trunk angles (10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees,) using a modified Monark cycle ergometer. All conditions were tested at a power output corresponding to 95 percent of the VO2 at each subject's ventilatory threshold while pedalling at 90 rpm and using aerodynamic handlebars. Sagittal-view kinematics for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were also recorded for all conditions and for the subjects' preferred positioning on their own bicycles. No combination of seat-tube and trunk angle could be considered optimal since many of the nine conditions elicited statistically similar mean VO2 and HR values. Mean hip angle (HA) was the only kinematic variable that changed consistently across conditions. A regression relationship was not observed between mean VO2 or HR and mean hip angle values (P greater than 0.45). Significant curvilinear relationships were observed, however, between delta VO2 (VO2 - minimum VO2) and delta HA (mean HA - preferred HA) using the data from all subjects (R = 0.45, SEE = 0.13 1.min-1) and using group mean values (R=0.93, SEE = 0.03 l.min-1). In both cases delta VO2 minimized at delta Ha = 0, which corresponded to the subjects' preferred HA from their own bicycles. Thus, subjects optimized their VO2 cost at cycle geometries that elicited similar lower-limb kinematics as the preferred geometries from their own bicycles.},

abstract = {We investigated how varying seat tube angle (STA) and hand position affect muscle kinematics and activation patterns during cycling in order to better understand how triathlon-specific bike geometries might mitigate the biomechanical challenges associated with the bike-to-run transition. Whole body motion and lower extremity muscle activities were recorded from 14 triathletes during a series of cycling and treadmill running trials. A total of nine cycling trials were conducted in three hand positions (aero, drops, hoods) and at three STAs (73° , 76° , 79° ). Participants also ran on a treadmill at 80, 90, and 100{\%} of their 10-km triathlon race pace. Compared with cycling, running necessitated significantly longer peak musculotendon lengths from the uniarticular hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle plantar flexors and the biarticular hamstrings, rectus femoris, and gastrocnemius muscles. Running also involved significantly longer periods of active muscle lengthening from the quadriceps and ankle plantar flexors. During cycling, increasing the STA alone had no affect on muscle kinematics but did induce significantly greater rectus femoris activity during the upstroke of the crank cycle. Increasing hip extension by varying the hand position induced an increase in hamstring muscle activity, and moved the operating lengths of the uniarticular hip flexor and extensor muscles slightly closer to those seen during running. These combined changes in muscle kinematics and coordination could potentially contribute to the improved running performances that have been previously observed immediately after cycling on a triathlon-specific bicycle. {\textcopyright} 2011 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {The authors tested 4 young healthy subjects walking with a powered knee exoskeleton to determine if it could reduce the metabolic cost of locomotion. Subjects walked with a backpack loaded and unloaded, on a treadmill with inclinations of 0° and 15°, and outdoors with varied natural terrain. Participants walked at a self-selected speed (average 1.0 m/s) for all conditions, except incline treadmill walking (average 0.5 m/s). The authors hypothesized that the knee exoskeleton would reduce the metabolic cost of walking uphill and with a load compared with walking without the exoskeleton. The knee exoskeleton reduced metabolic cost by 4.2{\%} in the 15° incline with the backpack load. All other conditions had an increase in metabolic cost when using the knee exoskeleton compared with not using the exoskeleton. There was more variation in metabolic cost over the outdoor walking course with the knee exoskeleton than without it. Our findings indicate that powered assistance at the knee is more likely to decrease the metabolic cost of walking in uphill conditions and during loaded walking rather than in level conditions without a backpack load. Differences in positive mechanical work demand at the knee for varying conditions may explain the differences in metabolic benefit from the exoskeleton.},

Furthermore, gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated. Nonelite runners performed a 10 km time trial 7 weeks before Copenhagen Marathon 2013 for estimation of running ability. Based on the time, runners were divided into two similar groups that eventually should perform the marathon by applying the two nutritional strategies. Matched pairs design was applied. Before the marathon, runners were paired based on their prerace running ability. Runners applying the freely chosen nutritional strategy (n = 14; 33.6 ± 9.6 years; 1.83 ± 0.09 m; 77.4 ± 10.6 kg; 45:40 ± 4:32 min for 10 km) could freely choose their in-race intake. Runners applying the scientifically based nutritional strategy (n = 14; 41.9 ± 7.6 years; 1.79 ± 0.11 m; 74.6 ± 14.5 kg; 45:44 ± 4:37 min) were targeting a combined in-race intake of energy gels and water, where the total intake amounted to approximately 0.750 L water, 60 g maltodextrin and glucose, 0.06 g sodium, and 0.09 g caffeine per hr. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a self-administered postrace questionnaire. Marathon time was 3:49:26 ± 0:25:05 and 3:38:31 ± 0:24:54 hr for runners applying the freely chosen and the scientifically based strategy, respectively (p = .010, effect size=-0.43). Certain runners experienced diverse serious gastrointestinal symptoms, but overall, symptoms were low and not different between groups (p {\textgreater} .05).

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the effect of racing position on the pedal forces, the kinematics of the lower limbs, the muscular joint moments and the muscular joint powers. Cycling in an upright position (UP) and in a dropped position (DP) was analyzed in six subjects during cycling at 200 W with a cadence of 80 rpm. The pedal forces showed only slight differences between the two positions. The kinematic analyses revealed that only the mean hip angle was affected by body position. The inverse dynamics showed that body position significantly influenced the joint powers. The main reason for these changed power outputs could be the change in mean sarcomere length and mean moment arm of the hip muscles with different racing positions. INTRODUCTION: In endurance cycling, a major goal is to maximize the cycling speed sustainable for a given distance. A variety of internal and external factors can influence cycling speed. Among these, physiological and biomechanical factors influence power production (internal factors), and mechanical and environmental factors affect mainly the relationship between power output and cycling speed (external factors). One of the only variables cyclists can adjust during a race to manage performance is body position. Body position can act both as an external factor and as an internal factor. The effect of body position on the relationship between power output and cycling speed can be calculated with the experimentally measured drag area in different body positions (Jeukendrup {\&} Martin, 2001). From this point of view, an upright posture is clearly detrimental. On the other hand, racing position in cycling could also act as an internal biomechanical factor influencing cycling patterns and power production. Some experimental studies have already shown that body position can significantly affect power output in endurance cycling (Jobson et al., 2008, unpublished work from our institute). The exact mechanisms underlying the increased power output with a more upright posture have not been analyzed in detail. Dorel et al. (2009) analyzed the influence of body position on the effective pedal force and on electromyographic patterns during cycling, but they did not measure the kinematics of the limbs nor the ineffective pedal force.The main goal of this study was to examine the effect of racing position on the pedal forces, the kinematics of the lower limbs, the muscular joint moments and the muscular joint powers.

This paper aims at providing a review on current issues of the known tools and techniques used for hypogravity simulation and their effects on human locomotion. Walking and running rely on the limb oscillatory mechanics, and one way to change its dynamic properties is to modify the level of gravity. Gravity has a strong effect on the optimal rate of limb oscillations, optimal walking speed, and muscle activity patterns, and gait transitions occur smoothly and at slower speeds at lower gravity levels. Altered center of mass movements and interplay between stance and swing leg dynamics may challenge new forms of locomotion in a heterogravity environment. Furthermore, observations in the lack of gravity effects help to reveal the intrinsic properties of locomotor pattern generators and make evident facilitation of nonvoluntary limb stepping. In view of that, space neurosciences research has participated in the development of new technologies that can be used as an effective tool for gait rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Walking is a complex dynamic task that requires the regulation of whole-body angular momentum to maintain dynamic balance while performing walking subtasks such as propelling the body forward and accelerating the leg into swing. In human walking, the primary mechanism to regulate angular momentum is muscle force generation. Muscles accelerate body segments and generate ground reaction forces that alter angular momentum about the body's center-of-mass to restore and maintain dynamic stability. In addition, gravity contributes to whole-body angular momentum through its contribution to the ground reaction forces. The purpose of this study was to generate a muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulation of normal walking to quantify how individual muscles and gravity contribute to whole-body angular momentum in the sagittal plane. In early stance, the uniarticular hip and knee extensors (GMAX and VAS), biarticular hamstrings (HAM) and ankle dorsiflexors (TA) generated backward angular momentum while the ankle plantar flexors (SOL and GAS) generated forward momentum. In late stance, SOL and GAS were the primary contributors and generated angular momentum in opposite directions. SOL generated primarily forward angular momentum while GAS generated backward angular momentum. The difference between muscles was due to their relative contributions to the horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces. Gravity contributed to the body's angular momentum in early stance and to a lesser extent in late stance, which was counteracted primarily by the plantar flexors. These results may provide insight into balance and movement disorders and provide a basis for developing locomotor therapies that target specific muscle groups. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Segmental power is used in human movement analyses to indicate the source and net rate of energy transfer between the rigid bodies of biomechanical models. Segmental power calculations are performed using segment endpoint dynamics (kinetic method). A theoretically equivalent method is to measure the rate of change in a segment's mechanical energy state (kinematic method). However, these two methods have not produced experimentally equivalent results for segments proximal to the foot, with the difference in methods deemed the “power imbalance.” In a 6 degree-of-freedom model, segments move independently, resulting in relative segment endpoint displacement and non-equivalent segment endpoint velocities at a joint. In the kinetic method, a segment's distal end translational velocity may be defined either at the anatomical end of the segment or at the location of the joint center (defined here as the proximal end of the adjacent distal segment). Our mathematical derivations revealed the power imbalance between the kinetic method using the anatomical definition and the kinematic method can be explained by power due to relative segment endpoint displacement. In this study, we tested this analytical prediction through experimental gait data from nine healthy subjects walking at a typical speed. The average absolute segmental power imbalance was reduced from 0.023 to 0.046 W/kg using the anatomical definition to ≤0.001 W/kg using the joint center definition in the kinetic method (95.56–98.39{\%} reduction). Power due to relative segment endpoint displacement in segmental power analyses is substantial and should be considered in analyzing energetic flow into and between segments.},

abstract = {Due to the redundant degrees of freedom (DOF) and nonlinearity of reactional kinetic elements within the human motor apparatus, controlling the complex dynamics of the human musculoskeletal system presents considerable difficulties. Based on this challenge, Bernstein (1967) viewed skill development as the process whereby the central nervous system (CNS) gains mastery of kinematic DOF and kinetic reactional elements (passive forces, moments etc.), with the highest level of skill characterised by optimal exploitation of reactional elements in the achievement of movement goals. A previous kinematic investigation into coordination differences in a complex multidirectional dance sequence demonstrated that general unfreezing of kinematic DOF occurred as dance skill progressed (Chang et al., submitted for publication). To gain insight into the role of angular reactional elements in skill, the present kinetic study investigated angular momentum and associated variables across three skill levels (beginners, intermediates, experts) within this same complex dance sequence. The results showed that the angular momenta of segments and accompanying angular reactional elements generally increased with skill level. More specifically, the findings suggested that while improvements in movement economy from cancellation of angular momentum between body segments occur early in skill progression, later in skill progression, experts utilise increased whole-body angular momentum. Although this is energetically expensive, it may enhance the aesthetic value of dance movements, and/or have mechanical advantages. Overall, the findings here provide support for Bernstein's (1967) model of skill development. Future research should quantify the relations between energy expenditure, key biomechanical variables that reflect skill and dance aesthetics as perceived by audiences.},

Despite a lengthy history of antipathy towards this industry, many peak sporting bodies and expert groups now support a pragmatic acceptance of the use of products which have passed a risk:benefit analysis of being safe, effective and legal, as well as appropriate to the athlete's age and maturation in their sport. Sports supplements can be grouped: sports foods which provide a practical form of nutrients to meet sports nutrition goals; medical supplements which may be needed to prevent or correct nutrient deficiencies that occur in athletes, and the larger category of performance supplements which claim either to directly enhance exercise capacity or to support activities that allow the athlete to train hard, recover, achieve physique goals or reduce the risk of illness and injury. Gaining an evidence base for this latter group is challenged by the scarcity of research in relation to the number of products on the market, as well as limitations or poor quality of some of the available studies. While controlled scientific trials and meta-analyses help to provide information about the general use of performance supplements, most high performance athletes are more interested in real-life issues that are hard to encapsulate (e.g. detecting benefits that are meaningful to the outcomes of sporting competition, accounting for the use of several supplements in combination or the use of same supplement over successive events). Strategies to isolate and explain the variability of benefits to individual athletes is also a topic demanding investigation.},

@article{Fitzsimons1998,
abstract = {Angiotensin (ANG) II is a powerful and phylogenetically widespread stimulus to thirst and sodium appetite. When it is injected directly into sensitive areas of the brain, it causes an immediate increase in water intake followed by a slower increase in NaCl intake. Drinking is vigorous, highly motivated, and rapidly completed. The amounts of water taken within 15 rain or so of injection can exceed what the animal would spontaneously drink in the course of its normal activities over 24 h. The increase in NaCl intake is slower in onset, more persistent, and affected by experience. Increases in circulating ANG II have similar effects on drinking, although these may be partly obscured by accompanying rises in blood pressure. The circumventricular organs, median preoptic nucleus, and tissue surrounding the anteroventral third ventricle in the lamina terminalis (AV3V region) provide the neuroanatomic focus for thirst, sodium appetite, and cardiovascular control, making extensive connections with the hypothalamus, limbic system, and brain stem. The AV3V region is well provided with angiotensinergic nerve endings and angiotensin AT1 receptors, the receptor type responsible for acute responses to ANG II, and it responds vigorously to the dipsogenic action of ANG II. The nucleus tractus solitarius and other structures in the brain stem form part of a negative-feedback system for blood volume control, responding to baroreceptor and volume receptor information from the circulation and sending ascending noradrenergic and other projections to the AV3V region. The subfornical organ, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and area postrema contain ANG II-sensitive receptors that allow circulating ANG II to interact with central nervous structures involved in hypovolemic thirst and sodium appetite and blood pressure control. Angiotensin peptides generated inside the blood-brain barrier may act as conventional neurotransmitters or, in view of the many instances of anatomic separation between sites of production and receptors, they may act as paracrine agents at a distance from their point of release. An attractive speculation is that some are responsible for long-term changes in neuronal organization, especially of sodium appetite. Anatomic mismatches between sites of production and receptors are less evident in limbic and brain stem structures responsible for body fluid homeostasis and blood pressure control. Limbic structures are rich in other neuroactive peptides, some of which have powerful effects on drinking, and they and many of the classical nonpeptide neurotransmitters may interact with ANG II to augment or inhibit drinking behavior. Because ANG II immunoreactivity and binding are so widely distributed in the central nervous system, brain ANG II is unlikely to have a role as circumscribed as that of circulating ANG II. Angiotensin peptides generated from brain precursors may also be involved in functions that have little immediate effect on body fluid homeostasis and blood pressure control, such as cell differentiation, regeneration and remodeling, or learning and memory. Analysis of the mechanisms of increased drinking caused by drugs and experimental procedures that activate the renal renin-angiotensin system, and clinical conditions in which renal renin secretion is increased, have provided evidence that endogenously released renal renin can generate enough circulating ANG II to stimulate drinking. But it is also certain that other mechanisms of thirst and sodium appetite still operate when the effects of circulating ANG II are blocked or absent, although it is not known whether this is also true for angiotensin peptides formed in the brain. Whether ANG II should be regarded primarily as a hormone released in hypovolemia helping to defend the blood volume, a neurotransmitter or paracrine agent with a privileged role in the neural pathways for thirst and sodium appetite of all kinds, a neural organizer especially in sodium appetite, or all of these, remains uncertain. ANG II-induced drinking behavior serves as a model of how other complex behaviors involving neural and peptide inputs might be organized.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to investigate the perceptions and practices of achieving ‘race weight' in a population of trained male cyclists. A secondary focus was to investigate the use of gym-based strength training, a possible attenuator of the side effects associated with weight reduction. Methods: A total of n = 97 well-trained cyclists ranging from local club level to international standard completed an online survey capturing data on the aforementioned topics. Results: Forty-nine percent of respondents indicated they were unsatisfied with their current bodyweight, with a similar percentage across club, national and international level riders. Riders who identified as climbers had lower reported bodyweight; however, all categories of riders expressed a desire to reduce bodyweight by a similar percentage (1.9{\%}, ± 3.4{\%}; 90{\%} CL). Seventy-seven percent of respondents indicated that they had recently tried or were currently trying to reduce bodyweight, most commonly by reducing food intake and avoiding sugary foods. Nine percent indicated they were using either supplements or medications to lower bodyweight, and 27{\%} reported having sought advice from a health professional. A higher proportion of international riders engaged in strength training (85{\%}), compared to national (50{\%}) and club (55{\%}) riders (p{\textless} 0.05). The most cited reasons for not strength training were time constraints and believing it was not beneficial to their cycling performance. Conclusion: These data suggest that trained male cyclists are a highly weight-conscious population who engage in a variety of practices to reduce weight. Practitioners should be aware of these tendencies, as they may carry significant health implications if poorly implemented.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that fast-running hexapeds must generate high levels of kinetic energy to cycle their limbs rapidly compared with bipeds and quadrupeds. We used high-speed video analysis to determine the three-dimensional movements of the limbs and bodies of cockroaches (Blaberus discoidalis) running on a motorized treadmill at 21 cms-1 using an alternating tripod gait. We combined these kinematic data with morphological data to calculate the mechanical energy produced to move the limbs relative to the overall center of mass and the mechanical energy generated to rotate the body (head + thorax + abdomen) about the overall center of mass. The kinetic energy involved in moving the limbs was 8 $\mu$J stride-1 (a power output of 21 mW kg-1), which was only approximately 13 {\%} of the external mechanical energy generated to lift and accelerate the overall center of mass at this speed. Pitch, yaw and roll rotational movements of the body were modest (less than ±7 °), and the mechanical energy required for these rotations was surprisingly small(l.7 $\mu$J stride-1 for pitch, 0.5 $\mu$J stride-1 for yaw and 0.4 $\mu$J stride-1 for roll) as was the power (4.2, 1.2 and 1.1 m Wkg-1, respectively). Compared at the same absolute forward speed, the mass-specific kinetic energy generated by the trotting hexaped to swing its limbs was approximately half of that predicted from data on much larger two-and four-legged animals. Compared at an equivalent speed (mid-trotting speed), limb kinetic energy was a smaller fraction of total mechanical energy for cockroaches than for large bipedal runners and hoppers and for quadrupedal trotters. Cockroaches operate at relatively high stride frequencies, but distribute ground reaction forces over a greater number of relatively small legs. The relatively small leg mass and inertia of hexapeds may allow relatively high leg cycling frequencies without exceptionally high internal mechanical energy generation.},

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that adaptations, initiated by exercise, can be amplified or reduced by nutrition. Various methods have been discussed to optimize training adaptations and some of these methods have been subject to extensive study. To date, most methods have focused on skeletal muscle, but it is important to note that training effects also include adaptations in other tissues (e.g., brain, vasculature), improvements in the absorptive capacity of the intestine, increases in tolerance to dehydration, and other effects that have received less attention in the literature. The purpose of this review is to define the concept of periodized nutrition (also referred to as nutritional training) and summarize the wide variety of methods available to athletes. The reader is referred to several other recent review articles that have discussed aspects of periodized nutrition in much more detail with primarily a focus on adaptations in the muscle. The purpose of this review is not to discuss the literature in great detail but to clearly define the concept and to give a complete overview of the methods available, with an emphasis on adaptations that are not in the muscle. Whilst there is good evidence for some methods, other proposed methods are mere theories that remain to be tested. ‘Periodized nutrition' refers to the strategic combined use of exercise training and nutrition, or nutrition only, with the overall aim to obtain adaptations that support exercise performance. The term nutritional training is sometimes used to describe the same methods and these terms can be used interchangeably. In this review, an overview is given of some of the most common methods of periodized nutrition including ‘training low' and ‘training high', and training with low- and high-carbohydrate availability, respectively. ‘Training low' in particular has received considerable attention and several variations of ‘train low' have been proposed. ‘Training-low' studies have generally shown beneficial effects in terms of signaling and transcription, but to date, few studies have been able to show any effects on performance. In addition to ‘train low' and ‘train high', methods have been developed to ‘train the gut', train hypohydrated (to reduce the negative effects of dehydration), and train with various supplements that may increase the training adaptations longer term. Which of these methods should be used depends on the specific goals of the individual and there is no method (or diet) that will address all needs of an individual in all situations. Therefore, appropriate practical application lies in the optimal combination of different nutritional training methods. Some of these methods have already found their way into training practices of athletes, even though evidence for their efficacy is sometimes scarce at best. Many pragmatic questions remain unanswered and another goal of this review is to identify some of the remaining questions that may have great practical relevance and should be the focus of future research.},

abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a critical role in delivering carbohydrate and fluid during prolonged exercise and can therefore be a major determinant of performance. The incidence of GI problems in athletes participating in endurance events is high, indicating that GI function is not always optimal in those conditions. A substantial body of evidence suggests that the GI system is highly adaptable. Gastric emptying as well as stomach comfort can be “trained” and perceptions of fullness decreased; some studies have suggested that nutrient-specific increases in gastric emptying may occur. Evidence also shows that diet has an impact on the capacity of the intestine to absorb nutrients. Again, the adaptations that occur appear to be nutrient specific. For example, a high-carbohydrate diet will increase the density of sodium-dependent glucose-1 (SGLT1) transporters in the intestine as well as the activity of the transporter, allowing greater carbohydrate absorption and oxidation during exercise. It is also likely that, when such adaptations occur, the chances of developing GI distress are smaller. Future studies should include more human studies and focus on a number of areas, including the most effective methods to induce gut adaptations and the timeline of adaptations. To develop effective strategies, a better understanding of the exact mechanisms underlying these adaptations is important. It is clear that “nutritional training” can improve gastric emptying and absorption and likely reduce the chances and/or severity of GI problems, thereby improving endurance performance as well as providing a better experience for the athlete. The gut is an important organ for endurance athletes and should be trained for the conditions in which it will be required to function.},

abstract = {This paper examines how selected physiological performance variables, such as maximal oxygen uptake, strength and power, might best be scaled for subject differences in body size. The apparent dilemma between using either ratio standards or a linear adjustment method to scale was investigated by considering how maximal oxygen uptake (1{\textperiodcentered}min-1), peak and mean power output (W) might best be adjusted for differences in body mass (kg). A curvilinear power function model was shown to be theoretically, physiologically and empirically superior to the linear models. Based on the fitted power functions, the best method of scaling maximum oxygen uptake, peak and mean power output, required these variables to be divided by body mass, recorded in the units kg2/3. Hence, the power function ratio standards (ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-2/3{\textperiodcentered}min-1) and (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-2/3) were best able to describe a wide range of subjects in terms of their physiological capacity, i.e. their ability to utilise oxygen or record power maximally, independent of body size. The simple ratio standards (ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) and (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) were found to best describe the same subjects according to their performance capacities or ability to run which are highly dependent on body size. The appropriate model to explain the experimental design effects on such ratio standards was shown to be log-normal rather than normal. Simply by taking logarithms of the power function ratio standard, identical solutions for the design effects are obtained using either ANOVA or, by taking the unscaled physiological variable as the dependent variable and the body size variable as the covariate, ANCOVA methods. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review is to consider genetic and other determinants of sweat sodium concentration that have practical implications for athletes. The premise is that sweat sodium loss impacts sports performance and that an acute sodium deficit can contribute to "heat cramping" (better termed "sweat cramping"), plasma volume contraction, and hypovolemic hyponatremia. The relevant literature is reviewed and critiqued. Salt-losing genes can predispose athletes to performance and clinical problems because of sodium deficits from heavy sweating. Genetics aside, sweat salt concentration tends to rise in concert with sweat rate. During heat acclimatization, the degree of salt-saving in sweat is influenced by dietary sodium content. Sodium depletion increases sweat salt-saving via the action of aldosterone on sweat glands. Any age or gender differences in sweat sodium concentration seem minor or not of concern for athletic performance. Athletes can learn to increase salt in diet and sports drinks to mitigate performance and clinical consequences of "salty sweating." Inventing a "dipstick" to measure sweat sodium concentration would help us fathom individual sodium needs among athletes. Genetic, dietary, and environmental determinants of sweat sodium concentration have practical implications for the performance and health of athletes. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {Hypohydration, or a body water deficit, is a common occurrence in athletes and recreational exercisers following the completion of an exercise session. For those who will undertake a further exercise session that day, it is important to replace water losses to avoid beginning the next exercise session hypohydrated and the potential detrimental effects on performance that this may lead to. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the research related to factors that may affect postexercise rehydration. Research in this area has focused on the volume of fluid to be ingested, the rate of fluid ingestion, and fluid composition. Volume replacement during recovery should exceed that lost during exercise to allow for ongoing water loss; however, ingestion of large volumes of plain water results in a prompt diuresis, effectively preventing longer-term maintenance of water balance. Addition of sodium to a rehydration solution is beneficial for maintenance of fluid balance due to its effect on extracellular fluid osmolality and volume. The addition of macronutrients such as carbohydrate and protein can promote maintenance of hydration by influencing absorption and distribution of ingested water, which in turn effects extracellular fluid osmolality and volume. Alcohol is commonly consumed in the postexercise period and may influence postexercise rehydration, as will the coingestion of food. Future research in this area should focus on providing information related to optimal rates of fluid ingestion, advisable solutions to ingest during different duration recovery periods, and confirmation of mechanistic explanations for the observations outlined.},

abstract = {Muscle contractile mechanics induced by the changing demands of human movement have the potential to influence our movement strategies. This study examined fascicle length changes of the triceps surae during jumping with added mass or increasing jump height to determine whether the chosen movement strategies were associated with relevant changes in muscle contractile properties. Sixteen participants jumped at sub-maximal and maximal intensities while total net work was matched via two distinct paradigms: (1) adding mass to the participant or (2) increasing jump height. Electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound analyses were performed to examine muscle activation, fascicle length and fascicle velocity changes of the triceps surae during jumping. Integrated EMG was significantly higher in the added mass paradigm with no difference in mean or maximal EMG, indicating that the muscle was activated for a significantly longer period of time but not activated to a greater intensity. Fascicle shortening velocity was slower with added mass compared than with increasing jump height; therefore, intrinsic force–velocity properties probably enabled increased force production. Improved fascicle contractile mechanics paired with a longer activation period probably produced a consistently larger fascicle force, enabling a greater impulse about the ankle joint. This may explain why previous research found that participants used an ankle-centred strategy for work production in the added mass paradigm and not in the jump height paradigm. The varied architecture of muscles within the lower limb may influence which muscles we choose to employ for work production under different task constraints.},

Healthy subjects with high-sweat [Na +] (SS) (91.0 ± 17.3 mmol/l), Controls with average sweat [Na +] (43.7 ± 9.9 mmol/l), and physically active CF patients with very high sweat [Na +] (132.6 ± 6.4 mmol/l) cycled in the heat without drinking until 3{\%} dehydration. Serum osmolality increased less (P {\textless} 0.05) in CF (6.1 ± 4.3 mosmol/kgH2O) and SS (8.4 ± 3.0 mosmol/kgH2O) compared with Control (14.8 ± 3.5 mosmol/kgH 2O). Relative change in plasma volume was greater (P {\textless} 0.05) in CF (-19.3 ± 4.5{\%}) and SS (-18.8 ± 3.1{\%}) compared with Control (-14.3 ± 2.3{\%}). Thirst during exercise and changes in plasma levels of vasopressin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone relative to percent dehydration were not different among groups. However, ad libitum fluid replacement was 40{\%} less, and serum NaCl concentration was lower for CF compared with SS and Control during recovery. Despite large variability in sweat electrolyte loss, thirst appears to be appropriately maintained during exercise in the heat as a linear function of dehydration, with relative contributions from hyperosmotic and hypovolemic stimuli dependent upon the magnitude of salt lost in sweat. CF exhibit lower ad libitum fluid restoration following dehydration, which may reflect physiological cues directed at preservation of salt balance over volume restoration. {\textcopyright} 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {This study was designed to determine how modifications in cycle geometry and lower-limb kinematics determine changes in oxygen uptake and lactate accumulation during submaximal cycle ergometry. First a series of tests with ten athletes was carried out with different seat-tube angles (STA test) determining different frame geometries. The tests performed with a rigid protocol show an interesting relationship between the trend of the coefficient of variation of O2 consumption (respiratory dynamics) and the forces measured on saddle and handlebar. The stabilization of the respiratory dynamics registered for a particular position could be considered as a first step of O2 consumption physiologic adaptation. For this reason a long term adaptation test (LTA test), in which the subject trained for 8 weeks with a determined STA, was executed to find out how long time spent using a specific frame geometry results in a minimization of the energetic cost of pedalling at a constant power output. The findings obtained suggest that, after a long training period with a bicycle frame geometry that minimizes the force exerted by the subject on saddle and handlebar, a stabilization of O2 consumption and a decrease of blood lactate accumulation occur. This physiologic adaptation of the human body means a decreasing trend of energy consumption in central (O2) and peripheral (lactate) level. Moreover this paper proposes an innovative method to determine the optimum cycling position, considering also the contribution of the upper part of the human body. In fact the original method proposed here, takes into consideration the horizontal components of the forces exerted on the handlebar and on the saddle as fundamental parameters for minimizing the ineffective efforts during cycling. This study is part of an extensive research that uses quantitative methods to establish the optimum rider position in order to minimize the muscular efforts performing a specific task, in aerobic phase. 1},

abstract = {In human walking, the center of mass motion is similar to an inverted pendulum. Viewing double support as a transition from one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method). Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work were approximately 33{\%} less than those calculated using the individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs greater than 97{\%} of the double support positive work while the leading leg performs greater than 94{\%} of the double support negative work. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {An athlete's carbohydrate intake can be judged by whether total daily intake and the timing of consumption in relation to exercise maintain adequate carbohydrate substrate for the muscle and central nervous system ("high carbohydrate availability") or whether carbohydrate fuel sources are limiting for the daily exercise programme ("low carbohydrate availability"). Carbohydrate availability is increased by consuming carbohydrate in the hours or days prior to the session, intake during exercise, and refuelling during recovery between sessions. This is important for the competition setting or for high-intensity training where optimal performance is desired. Carbohydrate intake during exercise should be scaled according to the characteristics of the event. During sustained high-intensity sports lasting {\~{}}1 h, small amounts of carbohydrate, including even mouth-rinsing, enhance performance via central nervous system effects. While 30-60 g {\textperiodcentered} h-1 is an appropriate target for sports of longer duration, events {\textgreater}2.5 h may benefit from higher intakes of up to 90 g {\textperiodcentered} h-1. Products containing special blends of different carbohydrates may maximize absorption of carbohydrate at such high rates. In real life, athletes undertake training sessions with varying carbohydrate availability. Whether implementing additional "train-low" strategies to increase the training adaptation leads to enhanced performance in well-trained individuals is unclear. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Three positions are generally used by cyclists: upright posture (UP), dropped posture (DP) and aero posture (AP). They determine different angles of trunk flexion which could be associated with physiological changes. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of these rider positions on ventilatory and metabolic variables. Nine male competitive cyclists (26.3 ± 3 yrs, mean ± SD) exercised on a cycle ergometer. Subjects performed three 10 min exercise bouts at 70{\%} V̇O2max (maximal oxygen uptake, l.min-1) in UP, DP and AP, in a randomized order. Each bout was separated by a 5 min active recovery period (50{\%} of V̇O2max). Ventilatory and gas exchange responses to exercise were averaged every min. Blood lactate concentration ([La](b), mM), blood pH were analysed at the 5th and the 10th min. The ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio, mean inspiratory flow, [La](b) and perceived exertion were significantly higher in DP (88.4 ± 11.4 l.min-1, 0.96 ± 0.05 ml s-12.52 ± 0.84 Mm and 13.6 ± 1.2) than in UP (84.8 ± 12.3 l.min-10.94 ± 0.05 ml s-1, 2.14 ± 0.99 Mm and 12.1 ± 1.5).

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of bicycle seat tube angles (STA) of (72° and 82°) on power production and EMG of the vastus laeralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), semimembranous (SM), biceps femoris (BF) during a Wingate test (WAT). Twelve experienced cyclists performed a WAT at each STA. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to identify differences in muscular activation by STA. EMG variables were normalized to isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Paired t-tests were used to test the effects of STA on: peak power, average power, minimum power and percent power drop. Results indicated BF activation was significantly lower at STA 82° (482.9 ± 166.6 {\%}MVC{\textperiodcentered}s) compared to STA 72° (712.6 ± 265.6 {\%}MVC{\textperiodcentered}s). There were no differences in the power variables between STAs. The primary finding was that increasing the STA from 72° to 82° enabled triathletes' to maintain power production, while significantly reducing the muscular activation of the biceps femoris muscle. {\textcopyright}Journal of Sports Science and Medicine (2006).},

abstract = {Previous studies have reported improved efficiency at steeper seat tube angle (STA) during ergometer cycling; however, neuromuscular mechanisms have yet to be fully determined. The current study investigated effects of STA on lower limb EMG activity at varying exercise intensities. Cyclists (n=11) were tested at 2 workloads; 160W and an individualised workload (IWL) equivalent to lactate threshold (TLac) minus 10{\%}$\delta$ (derived from maximal incremental data), using 3 STA (70, 75 and 80°). Electromyographic data from Vastus Medialis (VM), Rectus Femoris (RF), Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Biceps Femoris (BF) were assessed. The timing and magnitude of activation were quantified and analysed using a two-way ANOVA. STA had significant (P {\textless} 0.05) effects on timing of onset and offset of VM, timing of offset of VL, and angle at peak for RF, all occurring later at 80 vs. 70° STA at IWL. In RF, increased activity occurred during the first 108° of the crank cycle at 80 vs. 70° at IWL (P {\textless} 0.01). As most of the power in the pedal stroke is generated during the mid-section of the down-stroke, movement of the activation range of knee extensors into the predominantly power phase of the pedal stroke would potentially account for increased efficiency and decreased cardio-respiratory costs. Greater activity of bi-articular RF, in the first 108{\textordmasculine} of the crank cycle at IWL (80 vs. 70{\textordmasculine}) may more closely resemble the pelvic stabilising activity of RF in running biomechanics; and potentially explain the more effective transition from cycling to running reported in triathletes using steeper STA.},

The tests were randomized to complete the nine combinations (three seat heights, three tube angles) in opposite directions from a starting tube angle of 74°and 100{\%} trochanteric height to avoid any time or sequence bias. Power efficiency was calculated for each combination from work done and V̇O2. All results were analysed using ANOVA for repeated measures. At a seat tube angle of 80°, mean V̇O2 was significantly lower and power efficiency significantly higher compared with an angle of 74°at all three seat: heights, while heart rate was significantly lower only at: a seat height equal to trochanteric height. At a seat tube angle of 74°, mean V̇O2 and heart rate were significantly lower and power efficiency significantly higher compared with an angle of 68°at all three seat heights. Hip range of movement and maximum and minimum hip angle were significantly less at an angle of 80°compared with 68°. Further biomechanical analysis suggested that the improvement in cycling efficiency observed at steeper seat tube angles was produced in part by the resultant altered ankling pattern of the cyclist.},

abstract = {The main aim of this project was to study muscle activity patterns during steep uphill cycling (UC) (i.e., with a gradient of 20{\%}) with (1) normal saddle geometry and (2) with adjusted saddle position ASP (i.e., moving the saddle forward and changing the tilt of the saddle by 20{\%}). Based on our preliminary case study, we hypothesized that: (1) during 20{\%} UC muscle activity patterns would be different from those of level cycling (LC) and (2) during 20{\%} UC with ASP muscle activity patterns would resemble those of LC. Twelve trained male cyclists were tested on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer under three conditions with the same work rate (80{\%} of maximal power output) and cadence (90. rpm): level (LC), 20{\%} UC and 20{\%} UC with ASP. Electromyographic signals were acquired from m. tibialis anterior (TA), m. soleus (SO), m. gastrocnemius (GC), m. vastus lateralis (VL), m. vastus medialis (VM), m. rectus femoris (RF), m. biceps femoris (BF) and m. gluteus maximus (GM). Compared to LC, 20{\%} UC significantly modified both the timing and the intensity of activity of the selected muscles, while muscles that cross the hip joint were the most affected (RF later onset, earlier offset, shorter range of activity and decrease in peak amplitude of 34{\%}; BF longer range of activity; GM increase in peak amplitude of 44{\%}). These changes in EMG patterns during 20{\%} UC were successfully counteracted by the use of ASP and it was interesting to observe that the use of ASP during 20{\%} UC was perceived positively by all cyclists regarding both comfort and performance. These results could have a practical relevance in terms of improving performance during UC, together with reducing discomfort. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, we assessed the effects of saddle height on pedal forces, joint mechanical work and kinematics in 12 cyclists and 12 triathletes. Four sub-maximal 2-min cycling trials (3.4 W/kg and 90 rpm) were conducted using preferred, low and high saddle heights (±10° knee flexion at 6 o'clock crank position from the individual preferred height) and an advocated optimal saddle height (25° knee flexion at 6 o'clock crank position). Right pedal forces and lower limb kinematics were compared using effect sizes (ES). Increases in saddle height (5{\%} of preferred height, ES=4.6) resulted in large increases in index of effectiveness (7{\%}, ES=1.2) at the optimal compared to the preferred saddle height for cyclists. Greater knee (11-15{\%}, ES=1.6) and smaller hip (6-8{\%}, ES=1.7) angles were observed at the low (cyclists and triathletes) and preferred (triathletes only) saddle heights compared to high and optimal saddle heights. Smaller hip angle (5{\%}, ES=1.0) and greater hip range of motion (9{\%}, ES=1.0) were observed at the preferred saddle height for triathletes compared to cyclists. Changes in saddle height up to 5{\%} of preferred saddle height for cyclists and 7{\%} for triathletes affected hip and knee angles but not joint mechanical work.

abstract = {Besides its regulation by Union Cycliste Internationale, the evidence relating saddle setback to pedalling performance remains inconclusive. This study investigates the influence of saddle setback on pedalling effectiveness through two indexes: an index of pedalling force effectiveness and an index of pedalling work effectiveness. Eleven cyclists were assessed six saddle setback conditions while pedalling at a steady power output of 200 W and cadence of 90 rpm. A force sensor was integrated within the seat post to compute the centre of pressure on the saddle. From instrumented pedals, an index of force effectiveness (ratio between the force directed perpendicular to the crank arm and the total force applied to the pedal) and an index of work effectiveness (based on the minimisation of negative crank work) were calculated. In comparison with a forward position, sitting backward significantly decreased 5{\%} cumulative total work, increased index of work effectiveness (84.2 ± 3.7 vs. 82.0 ± 4.7{\%}), and increased index of force effectiveness (41.7 ± 2.9 vs. 39.9 ± 3.7 and 36.9 ± 0.7{\%}). Thus, while it was previously reported that sitting more forward favours maximal power, this study demonstrates that it also leads to a decreased effectiveness in steady-state pedalling.},

abstract = {Heat acclimation (HA) involves physiological adaptations that directly promote exercise performance in hot environments. However, for endurance-athletes it is unclear if adaptations also improve aerobic capacity and performance in cool conditions, partly because previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies have been restricted to short intervention periods. Prolonged HA was therefore deployed in the present RCT study including 21 cyclists [38 ± 2 years, 184 ± 1 cm, 80.4 ± 1.7 kg, and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 58.1 ± 1.2 mL/min/kg; mean ± SE] allocated to either 5½ weeks of training in the heat [HEAT (n = 12)] or cool control [CON (n = 9)]. Training registration, familiarization to test procedures, determination of VO2max, blood volume and 15 km time trial (TT) performance were assessed in cool conditions (14°C) during a 2-week lead-in period, as well as immediately pre and post the intervention. Participants were instructed to maintain total training volume and complete habitual high intensity intervals in normal settings; but HEAT substituted part of cool training with 28 ± 2 sessions in the heat (1 h at 60{\%} VO2max in 40°C; eliciting core temperatures above 39°C in all sessions), while CON completed all training in cool conditions. Acclimation for HEAT was verified by lower sweat sodium [Na+], reduced steady-state heart rate and improved submaximal exercise endurance in the heat. However, when tested in cool conditions both peak power output and VO2max remained unchanged for HEAT (pre 60.0 ± 1.5 vs. 59.8 ± 1.3 mL O2/min/kg). TT performance tested in 14°C was improved for HEAT and average power output increased from 298 ± 6 to 315 ± 6 W (P},

abstract = {Purpose: Historically, the efficiency of leg cycling has been difficult to change. However, arm cycling research indicates that relative crank angle changes can improve efficiency. Therefore, we investigated if leg cycling with different relative crank angles affects efficiency. Methods: Ten healthy, male, recreational bicycle riders (27.8 ± 8.2 years, mean ± SD, mass 69.8 ± 3.2 kg) pedaled a pan-loaded cycle ergometer at a fixed power output of 150 watts at a cadence of 90 RPM. Each subject completed six, 5-min trials in random order at relative crank angles of 180°, 135°, 90°, 45°, 0°, and 180°. We averaged rates of oxygen uptake (V ˙ O 2) and carbon dioxide production (V ˙ CO 2), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) for the last 2 min of each trial. Results: Crank angles other than 180° required a greater metabolic cost. As relative crank angle decreased from 180°, metabolic power monotonically increased by 1.6{\%} at 135° to 8.2{\%} greater when the relative crank angle was 0° (p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: We find that, unlike arm cycling, radically changing the relative crank angle on a bicycle from an out-of-phase (180°) to in-phase (0°) position decreases leg cycling efficiency by {\~{}}8{\%}. We attribute the increase to changes in cost of breathing, muscle co-activation, trunk stabilization, power fluctuations, and possibly lifting the legs during the upstroke. Our findings may have relevance in the rehabilitation of patients recovering from stroke or spinal cord injury.},

Seven mountain-bike trained cyclists completed two incremental maximal tests, separated by 48. h, one for each crank system. Each test started with a workload of 100. W and was increased by 30.

EMG was compared using a general linear model considering as factors the crank system and workload with post hoc analysis at $\alpha$=0.05. RMS presented effect of workload, but no effect of crank system was found for the muscles analyzed.

abstract = {The power required for flight in any flying animal is a function of flight speed. The power curve that describes this function has become an icon of studies of flight mechanics and physiology because it encapsulates the accessible animal's flight performance. The mechanical or aerodynamic power curve, describing the increase in kinetic energy of the air due to the passage of the bird, is necessarily U-shaped, for aerodynamic reasons, and can be estimated adequately by lifting-line theory. Predictions from this and related models agree well with measured mechanical work in flight and with results from flow visualization experiments. The total or metabolic power curve also includes energy released by the animal as heat, and is more variable in shape. These curves may be J-shaped for smaller birds and bats, but are difficult to predict theoretically owing to uncertainty about internal physiological processes and the efficiency of the flight muscles. The limitations of some existing models aiming to predict metabolic power curves are considered. The metabolic power curve can be measured for birds or bats flying in wind tunnels at controlled speeds. Simultaneous determination in European starlings Sturnus vulgaris of oxygen uptake, total metabolic rate (using labelled isotopes), aerodynamic power output and heat released (using digital video thermography) enable power curves to be determined with confidence; flight muscle efficiency is surprisingly low (averaging 15-18{\%}) and increases moderately with flight speed, so that the metabolic power curve is shallower than predicted by models. Accurate knowledge of the power curve is essential since extensive predictions of flight behaviour have been based upon it. The hypothesis that the power curve may not in fact exist, in the sense that the cost of flight may not be perceived by a bird as a continuous smooth function of air speed, is advanced but has not yet formally been tested. This hypothesis is considered together with evidence from variation in flight behaviour, wingbeat kinematics and flight gait with speed. Possible constraints on flight behaviour can be modelled by the power curves: these include the effect of a maximum power output and a constraint on maximum speed determined by downstroke wingbeat geometry and the relationship between thrust and lift.},

abstract = {It is perceived that, during the triathlon or duathlon, cycling with a steep ({\textgreater}76°) rather than a shallow ({\textless}76°) frame geometry might attenuate the fatigue associated with progression from the cycle to run disciplines and improve subsequent 10-km running performance. This is based on anecdotal testimony from athletes purporting to have experienced improved performance; no empirical evidence exists. To evaluate this view, eight male triathletes completed a counterbalanced, 40-km cycle ride at two frame geometries (73° and 81°) at {\~{}} 70{\%} (Formula Present). Immediately after completion of each 40-km cycle, a self-paced 10-km treadmill time trial was undertaken, during which physiological, kinematic and performance variables were measured. The 10-km run performance (mean ± s: 42:55 ± 4:19 $\nu$s 46:15 ± 4:52 min; P {\textless} 0.01) and combined cycle and run performance (1:45:49 ± 5:45 $\nu$s 1:50:33 ± 6:08; P {\textless} 0.001) were faster in the 81° than the 73° condition. Improvements in performance were most prominent during the first 5 km of the run (21:41 ± 2:15 $\nu$s 24:15 ± 2:31 min in the 81° and 73° conditions respectively). These improvements were not evident during the second 5 km of the run. No differences in physiological variables were noted, although heart rate, stride length and stride frequency were increased during the 81° condition (P {\textless} 0.05). Modifying frame geometry from a seat tube angle of 73° to 81° improves 10-km running and combined cycle plus run performance. These improvements in performance might relate to alterations during the cycling phase, which minimizes the `residual effect' of this (i.e. the adverse changes in substrate availability, thermoregulatory, cardiovascular and biomechanical factors felt immediately after transition from cycling to running) and attenuates negative changes in physiological and kinematic responses during the 10-km run. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

Pmet increased from 10.4 to 14.9W as flight speed was increased from 6.3 to 14.4ms-1 and was compatible with the U-shaped power/speed curve predicted by the aerodynamic models. Flight muscle efficiency varied between 0.13 and 0.23 depending upon the bird, the flight speed and the aerodynamic model used to calculate Pmech. Pmet during flight is often estimated by extrapolation from the mechanical power predicted by aerodynamic models by dividing Pmech by a flight muscle efficiency of 0.23 and adding the costs of basal metabolism, circulation and respiration. This method would underestimate measured Pmet by 15-25{\%} in our birds. The mean discrepancy between measured and predicted Pmet could be reduced to 0.1±1.5{\%} if flight muscle efficiency was altered to a value of 0.18. A flight muscle efficiency of 0.18 rather than 0.23 should be used to calculate the flight costs of birds in the size range of starlings (approximately 0.1kg) if Pmet is calculated from Pmech derived from aerodynamic models.},

Oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE) were measured during cycling at each of three STA (80°, 60°, 40°) and at constant 60° upper body angle using a custom made steady-state ergometer. 12 male untrained students (age 24.5 ± 1.6 years) were recruited and submaximal cycling tests (work load: 35{\%} of individual peak power, cadence: 60rpm, duration: 30min) were performed. Measured mean VO2 were 24.6 ± 2.8, 25.2 ± 2.9 and 24.8 ± 2.5 ml/min z.ast;kg and mean heart rates were 140.7 ± 10, 132.8 ± 8.8 and 131.7 ± 10.1 beat/min at 80°, 60° and 40° STA, respectively. There was no significant difference on the oxygen consumption but the mean heart rate at 60° and 40° STA was significantly lower than at 80° STA. In conclusion, riding a bicycle at shallow STA is as cost efficient as at steep STA and is better in terms of heart rate which is evaluated to be more suitable postures for casual cycling. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The limits of flight performance have been estimated in tethered Drosophila melanogaster by modulating power requirements in a 'virtual reality' flight arena. At peak capacity, the flight muscles can sustain a mechanical power output of nearly 80 W kg-1 muscle mass at 24 °C, which is sufficient to generate forces of approximately 150{\%} of the animal's weight. The increase in flight force above that required to support body weight is accompanied by a rise in wing velocity, brought about by an increase in stroke amplitude and a decrease in stroke frequency. Inertial costs, although greater than either profile or induced power, would be minimal with even modest amounts of elastic storage, and total mechanical power energy should be equivalent to aerodynamic power alone. Because of the large profile drag expected at low Reynolds numbers, the profile power was approximately twice the induced power at all levels of force generation. Thus, it is the cost of overcoming drag, and not the production of lift, that is the primary requirement for flight in Drosophila melanogaster. By comparing the estimated mechanical power output with respirometrically measured total power input, we determined that muscle efficiency rises with increasing force production to a maximum of 10{\%}. This change in efficiency may reflect either increased crossbridge activation or a favorable strain regime during the production of peak forces.},

abstract = {One of the most physically demanding parts of triathlon is the transition from cycling to running. Many tri-athletes believe that increasing seat-tube angle (STA) can bring advantages in the following running part. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of inverting the support of the seat, for increasing STA, on the metabolic response and on the muscle activation pattern, maintaining a controlled kinematic. Moreover, a muscle-skeletal model was applied to evaluate the hypothesis that increasing STA changes force-producing capabilities of muscles crossing the hip.Ten tri-athletes cycled at two different power levels and with two different STA's. Gas exchange data, kinematics and surface electromyography (sEMG) were acquired during the tests. sEMG was measured from eight muscles of the right side of the body. A model of muscle mechanics and energy expenditure was applied to estimate variations of force production capabilities and muscle energy consumption between the two STA configurations.Inverting the support of the seat showed no significant effects on kinematic, Oxygen consumption, muscle activations and muscle power production capabilities. Nevertheless, an interesting advantage can be the tendency to less activate gastrocnemius and biceps femoris: this could lead to minor muscle fatigue during the following running phase. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

There was no significant difference in knee motion between the patients and normal subjects. The patients with knee OA had a significantly reduced internal knee extensor moment compared to normal subjects. This difference reflects the patient's compensation to reduce the knee joint loading. Further, subjects with OA and a higher body mass index have a lower knee extensor moment. The female subjects had significantly greater knee flexion and a greater knee extensor moment. This gender difference may partially explain the increased prevalence of OA in females. Most tests of OA treatments are assessed by criteria that do not reflect functional activities.

We propose four themes that provide a basis for the systematic evaluation of the neural and neuromuscular fatigue mechanisms: 1) task dependency to identify the conditions that activate the various mechanisms; 2) force-fatigability relationship to explore the interaction between the mechanisms that results in a hyperbolic relationship between force and endurance time; 3) muscle wisdom to examine the association among a concurrent decline in force, relaxation rate, and motor neuron discharge that results in an optimization of force; and 4) sense of effort to determine the role of effort in the impairment of performance. On the basis of this perspective with an emphasis on neural mechanisms, we suggest a number of experiments to advance our understanding of the neurobiology of muscle fatigue.},

abstract = {Once thought to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now known to form continuously under aerobic conditions. Shuttling between producer and consumer cells fulfills at least three purposes for lactate: (1) a major energy source, (2) the major gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) a signaling molecule. “Lactate shuttle” (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine, it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a “strain” and not a “stress” biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in sports medicine. The above, as well as historic and recent studies of lactate metabolism and shuttling, are discussed in the following review. Though originally thought of as a metabolic waste product and fatigue agent, lactate can now be regarded as the link between glycolytic and aerobic pathways. From its discovery to more recent clinical applications, Brooks provides a comprehensive look at lactate metabolism and shuttling in both basic physiology and medicine.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to the study of oxygen uptake (VO2) dynamics or kinetics. Following the onset of exercise, both muscle and pulmonary VO2 rise in a near-exponential fashion towards the anticipated "steady-state" VO2 demand. However, it can take 2-4 min, or even longer at higher work rates, before this steady state is attained. Slow VO2 kinetics increase the so-called O-2 deficit and obligate a greater contribution from anaerobic mechanisms of ATP production (involving the breakdown of muscle high energy phosphates and lactate production from glycogen) to meet the ATP requirement, of the exercise task. A primary goal in this area of research is therefore to elucidate the physiological mechanisms which control and/or limit the rate at which muscle VO2 increases following the onset of exercise. At higher intensities of exercise, a continued increase in both muscle and pulmonary VO, is observed with time despite the external work rate remaining constant. This continued rise in VO2, beyond the anticipated steady-state requirement for the work rate, has been termed the VO2 "Slow component," and establishing the mechanistic basis for this phenomenon is another important goal of research in this field. This paper provides an overview of some of the factors which might contribute to both the fundamental and slow phases of the VO, kinetics and, in so doing, provides general background material for the more specific papers that follow.},

Purpose: This study aims to investigate nerve distribution patterns of human lower leg skeletal muscles using a modified Sihler's staining method. Methods: Sixteen lower leg from eight fresh adult cadavers were used in this study and all the skeletal muscles were dissected. The muscle specimens were classified according to Lim's classification. The specimens were then stained by further modified Sihler's staining technique. Data were analyzed according to research results. Results: After the staining, we found four patterns of nerve distribution in human lower leg muscles: (1) Type 1: single nerve pattern in which the nerve branches into two either running parallel to each other or radiating in a spray pattern (such as the extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, fibularis brevis and flexor hallucis longus). (2) Type 2: double nerve pattern, one being proximal and the other being distal (such as the extensor digitorum longus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus). (3) Type 3: multiple branch pattern (such as the tibialis anterior, fibularis longus, gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior and popliteus). Conclusion: Our modified Sihler's staining method is useful for research of large muscles and intramuscular nerves in human. These findings might provide guidance for clinicians for muscle reconstruction surgery.},

abstract = {The V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ slow component, a slowly developing increase in V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ during constant-work-rate exercise performed above the lactate threshold, represents a progressive loss of skeletal muscle contractile efficiency and is associated with the fatigue process. This brief review outlines the current state of knowledge concerning the mechanistic bases of the V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ slow component and describes practical interventions that can attenuate the slow component and thus enhance exercise tolerance. There is strong evidence that, during constant-work-rate exercise, the development of the V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ slow component is associated with the progressive recruitment of additional (type II) muscle fibers that are presumed to have lower efficiency. Recent studies, however, indicate that muscle efficiency is also lowered (resulting in a "mirror-image" V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ slow component) during fatiguing, high-intensity exercise in which additional fiber recruitment is unlikely or impossible. Therefore, it seems that muscle fatigue underpins the V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ slow component, although the greater fatigue sensitivity of recruited type II fibers might still play a crucial role in the loss of muscle efficiency in both situations. Several interventions can reduce the magnitude of the V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ slow component, and these are typically associated with an enhanced exercise tolerance. These include endurance training, inspiratory muscle training, priming exercise, dietary nitrate supplementation, and the inspiration of hyperoxic gas. All of these interventions reduce muscle fatigue development either by improving muscle oxidative capacity and thus metabolic stability or by enhancing bulk muscle O2 delivery or local Q{\textperiodcentered}O₂-to-V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ matching. Future honing of these interventions to maximize their impact on the V{\textperiodcentered}O₂ slow component might improve sports performance in athletes and exercise tolerance in the elderly or in patient populations.},

abstract = {The cardioaccelerator and ventilatory responses to rhythmic exercise in the human are commonly viewed as being mediated predominantly via feedforward 'central command' mechanisms, with contributions from locomotor muscle afferents to the sympathetically mediated pressor response. We have assessed the relative contributions of three types of feedback afferents on the cardiorespiratory response to voluntary, rhythmic exercise by inhibiting their normal 'tonic' activity in healthy animals and humans and in chronic heart failure. Transient inhibition of the carotid chemoreceptors during moderate intensity exercise reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and increased limb vascular conductance and blood flow; and reducing the normal level of respiratory muscle work during heavier intensity exercise increased limb vascular conductance and blood flow. These cardiorespiratory effects were prevented via ganglionic blockade and were enhanced in chronic heart failure and in hypoxia. Blockade of $\mu$ opioid sensitive locomotor muscle afferents, with preservation of central motor output via intrathecal fentanyl: (a) reduced the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate and ventilatory responses to all steady state exercise intensities; and (b) during sustained high intensity exercise, reduced O(2) transport, increased central motor output and end-exercise muscle fatigue and reduced endurance performance. We propose that these three afferent reflexes - probably acting in concert with feedforward central command - contribute significantly to preserving O(2) transport to locomotor and to respiratory muscles during exercise. Locomotor muscle afferents also appear to provide feedback concerning the metabolic state of the muscle to influence central motor output, thereby limiting peripheral fatigue development.},

abstract = {Much is known about the physiological impairments that can cause muscle fatigue. It is known that fatigue can be caused by many different mechanisms, ranging from the accumulation of metabolites within muscle fibres to the generation of an inadequate motor command in the motor cortex, and that there is no global mechanism responsible for muscle fatigue. Rather, the mechanisms that cause fatigue are specific to the task being performed. The development of muscle fatigue is typically quantified as a decline in the maximal force or power capacity of muscle, which means that submaximal contractions can be sustained after the onset of muscle fatigue. There is even evidence that the duration of some sustained tasks is not limited by fatigue of the principal muscles. Here we review experimental approaches that focus on identifying the mechanisms that limit task failure rather than those that cause muscle fatigue. Selected comparisons of tasks, groups of individuals and interventions with the task-failure approach can provide insight into the rate-limiting adjustments that constrain muscle function during fatiguing contractions.},

The sensor output was validated against the gold standard measures of custom made mechanical testing apparatuses. The IMUs provide an accurate (within 0.6°) and precise (within 0.1°) measurement of static sensor orientation and an accurate (within 4.4° per second) and precise (within 0.2° per second) representation of angular velocity. The sensors are more accurate at lower velocities, but the percent error remains relatively constant across all angular velocities. Inclusion of IMUs as an appropriate measurement tool should be based on the application, specific demands and necessary reliability.},

abstract = {Locomotor muscle fatigue, defined as an exercise-induced reduction in maximal voluntary force, occurs during prolonged exercise, but its effects on cardiorespiratory responses and exercise performance are unknown. In this investigation, a significant reduction in locomotor muscle force (-18{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05) was isolated from the metabolic stress usually associated with fatiguing exercise using a 100-drop-jumps protocol consisting of one jump every 20 s from a 40-cm-high platform. The effect of this treatment on time to exhaustion during high-intensity constant-power cycling was measured in study 1 (n = 10). In study 2 (n = 14), test duration (871 +/- 280 s) was matched between fatigue and control condition (rest). In study 1, locomotor muscle fatigue caused a significant curtailment in time to exhaustion (636 +/- 278 s) compared with control (750 +/- 281 s) (P = 0.003) and increased cardiac output. Breathing frequency was significantly higher in the fatigue condition in both studies despite similar oxygen consumption and blood lactate accumulation. In study 2, high-intensity cycling did not induce further fatigue to eccentrically-fatigued locomotor muscles. In both studies, there was a significant increase in heart rate in the fatigue condition, and perceived exertion was significantly increased in study 2 compared with control. These results suggest that locomotor muscle fatigue has a significant influence on cardiorespiratory responses and exercise performance during high-intensity cycling independently from metabolic stress. These effects seem to be mediated by the increased central motor command and perception of effort required to exercise with weaker locomotor muscles.},

The following papers by Richard Lieber (Skeletal Muscle as an Actuator), Thomas Roberts (Elastic Mechanisms and Muscle Function), Silvia Blemker (Skeletal Muscle has a Mind of its Own: a Computational Framework to Model the Complex Process of Muscle Adaptation) and Sabrina Lee (Muscle Properties of Spastic Muscle (Stroke and CP) are summaries of their representative contributions for the session on skeletal muscle mechanics, energetics and plasticity at the 2016 Biomechanics and Neural Control of Movement Conference (BANCOM 2016). Dr. Lieber revisits the topic of sarcomere length as a fundamental property of skeletal muscle contraction. Specifically, problems associated with sarcomere length non-uniformity and the role of sarcomerogenesis in diseases such as cerebral palsy are critically discussed. Dr. Roberts then makes us aware of the (often neglected) role of the passive tissues in muscles and discusses the properties of parallel elasticity and series elasticity, and their role in muscle function. Specifically, he identifies the merits of analyzing muscle deformations in three dimensions (rather than just two), because of the potential decoupling of the parallel elastic element length from the contractile element length, and reviews the associated implications for the architectural gear ratio of skeletal muscle contraction. Dr. Blemker then tackles muscle adaptation using a novel way of looking at adaptive processes and what might drive adaptation. She argues that cells do not have pre-programmed behaviors that are controlled by the nervous system. Rather, the adaptive responses of muscle fibers are determined by sub-cellular signaling pathways that are affected by mechanical and biochemical stimuli; an exciting framework with lots of potential. Finally, Dr. Lee takes on the challenging task of determining human muscle properties in vivo. She identifies the dilemma of how we can demonstrate the effectiveness of a treatment, specifically in cases of muscle spasticity following stroke or in children with cerebral palsy. She then discusses the merits of ultrasound based elastography, and the clinical possibilities this technique might hold. Overall, we are treated to a vast array of basic and clinical problems in skeletal muscle mechanics and physiology, with some solutions, and many suggestions for future research.},

Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic drafting, vortice uplift, Bernoulli suction, thermoregulatory coupling, path following, physical hooks, synchronization, and cooperation are only some of the better-known examples. While drafting mechanisms also appear in non-biological systems such as sedimentation and particle vortices, the broad spectrum of these mechanisms appears more diversely in biological systems that include bacteria, spermatozoa, various aquatic species, birds, land animals, semi-fluid dwellers like turtle hatchlings, as well as human systems. We present the thermodynamic framework for energy saving mechanisms, and we review evidence in favor of the variation range hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that, as an evolutionary process, the variation range between strongest and weakest group members converges on the equivalent energy saving quantity that is generated by the energy saving mechanism. We also review self-organized structures that emerge due to energy saving mechanisms, including convective processes that can be observed in many systems over both short and long time scales, as well as high collective output processes in which a form of collective position locking occurs.},

abstract = {The aims of this research were to firstly investigate the effect of crosswinds on the aerodynamic behaviour of cyclists and secondly, to determine which parameters (cyclist position and bike type) influenced the aerodynamic forces on cyclists the most. The aerodynamic response of two different full-scale bikes with and without a mannequin has been recorded for a variety of crosswind angles ranging from 0° - 90° (in 15° increments). The results showed that the wind induced force is a function of the crosswind angle. The actual aerodynamic loads arising from such winds can be up to about 2.5 times the aerodynamic drag. It has also been observed that the torso angle has little effect on the lateral force coefficient. In contrast, the bike type significantly affects the aerodynamic forces: at large yaw angles, a road bike is responsible for approximately 60 {\%} of the total lateral force coefficient. This study is the first step in the process of determining the effect of crosswind from a full range of angles of attack on cyclists, and will help to improve the safety of cyclists and equipment, and to define guidelines for cycling lanes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The world-class cyclist's power output (PO) data and training indices were analysed over six years to determine the evolution of his record power profile and training load (TL), which were estimated by using the session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method. The total annual duration and TL increased through six seasons by 79{\%} and 83{\%}, respectively. The record POs in all exercise intensity zones improved over the six years. The increases in TL, monotony (+34{\%}) and strain (+162{\%}) from the junior category to the world-class level significantly correlated with an improvement in his aerobic potential, which was characterised by an increase in the record POs between 5 min and 4 h. This case study of the performance level and training parameters of a world-class cyclist provides comprehensive insight into the evolution of a cyclist to the top level. Furthermore, determining the record power profile of this athlete over six competitive seasons illuminates the maturation of the physical potential of a top-10 Grand Tour finisher.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lowering time trial torso angle positions on muscle activation patterns and crank torque coordination. It was hypothesized that small torso angles yield a forward shift of the muscle activation timing and crank torque. Twenty-one trained cyclists performed three exercise bouts at 70{\%} maximal aerobic power in a time trial position at three different torso angles (0°, 8°, and 16°) at a fixed cadence of 85 rpm. Measurements included surface electromyography, crank torques and gas exchange. A significant increase in crank torque range and forward shift in peak torque timing was found at smaller torso angles. This relates closely with the later onset and duration of the muscle activation found in the gluteus maximus muscle. Torso angle effects were only observed in proximal monoarticular muscles. Moreover, all measured physiological variables (oxygen consumption, breathing frequency, minute ventilation) were significantly increased with lowering torso angle and hence decreased the gross efficiency. The findings provide support for the notion that at a cycling intensity of 70{\%} maximal aerobic power, the aerodynamic gains outweigh the physiological/biomechanical disadvantages in trained cyclists.},

abstract = { It has been shown theoretically that performance can be enhanced by varying power in parallel with variable ambient conditions. However, no theoretical model has considered aerobic substrate utilization dynamics, limited carbohydrate stores, force–velocity relationships, and proper efficiency modelling. Furthermore, no study has investigated optimal pacing for courses with continuously variable ambient wind directions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a model for the optimization of pacing strategies in road cycling with an updated bioenergetic model. The purpose of this model was to optimize pacing strategies for courses with continuously variable wind directions on both short (2 km) and long (100 km) courses. For this purpose, a numerical model consisting of three sub-models was programmed into the MATLAB software. This model consisted of one mechanical simulation model for cycling locomotion, one bioenergetic model based on the Margaria–Morton–Sundstr{\"{o}}m model, and the method of moving asymptotes for optimization of the pacing strategy. Results showed that by optimizing the pacing strategies, time gains of 4.9{\%} and 5.7{\%} were attained for the 2-km courses with and without an ambient wind of 5 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1, respectively. The corresponding time gains for the 100-km courses were 1.4{\%} and 2.0{\%} with and without ambient wind, respectively. The theoretical model in this study further resulted in all-out strategies for the flat 2-km courses with and without ambient wind. Moreover, the 100-km course without wind was met with a positive pacing strategy and the 100-km course with ambient wind was met with a compromise of positive pacing and variable power distribution in parallel with the variable ambient wind conditions. In conclusion, the model presented in this study performed more detailed bioenergetic simulations than previous pacing strategy optimization studies, and this resulted in more detailed pacing strategies for long courses. },

abstract = {It is well-known in elite cycling that a cyclist riding behind a car experiences a substantial reduction in aerodynamic resistance or drag. However, the upstream effect by a following car on the cyclist in front of it is not well-known and has, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been reported in the scientific literature. It is also not taken into account in elite cycling, as for individual time trials, the rules of the International Cycling Union (UCI) only specify a minimum distance between rider and car of 10 m because of safety reasons. Furthermore, during actual races, this limit is often not kept and not strictly enforced. Nevertheless, during individual time trials, there is always at least one, but often more, following cars, potentially influencing the cyclist drag. This study presents the results of CFD simulations and wind tunnel measurements to ascertain and quantify the upstream effect by a following car on the drag of the cyclist in front of it. CFD simulations are performed based on the steady-state Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the standard k- $\epsilon$ model for closure. The simulations are validated based on a series of wind tunnel measurements. The drag reduction for the cyclist ranges from 3.7{\%} over 1.4{\%} to 0.2{\%} for realistic separation distances of 3, 5 and 10 m, respectively. For a typical 50. km individual time trial, the potential time reduction by exploiting this effect (e.g. by a car following the rider at this short distance versus no car behind) is 62.4 s, 24.1 s and 3.9 s, respectively. As elite cyclist time trials are often won based on seconds or sometimes even less, these differences can be decisive for who wins the stage. Therefore, it is recommended that the UCI not only raises its current minimum separation distance of 10 m to at least 30 m, but also strictly enforces it, to avoid this unwanted aerodynamic effect that can influence the outcome of the race.},

abstract = {This paper reports aerodynamic testing results of various styles of bicycle wheels across yaw angles of 0 to 30 degrees. Wheels considered include disc wheels, a bladed spoke wheel and various depth dished wheels. Testing has been completed in a three quarter open jet test section wind tunnel with a anthropomorphic mannequin and rotating front and rear wheels. Data is provided as to the influence of the wheel type on the overall drag and side force, and yaw and roll moment of the rider and bicycle combination. The results demonstrate that the wheel type has a significant effect on both the aerodynamic drag and stability of the bicycle system, and that evaluation of wheel aerodynamic performance should not be based on drag alone. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The current International Human Powered Vehicle Association world records for faired bicycles stand at 133.284km/h for the 200m flying start speed record and 91.562 km for the hour record. Traditionally the recumbent bicycles that have been developed for breaking one of either of these records have been optimized around a specific, relatively small rider, enabling the overall size to be kept small. Creating the smallest frontal area possible and optimal aerodynamic shape were then the design goals. This paper discusses the development of the Velox recumbent bicycle, which has been designed using another approach. The power required to break either of the records depends mostly on air resistance. Therefore small riders have the advantage of allowing for smaller frontal areas, whilst larger riders are able to provide more power. Performance optimization, lead to a design based around an average 1.95m tall male rider for Velox. The aerodynamic shape of Velox was then developed around the above criterion and designed with CFD and validated with wind tunnel and road tests. Essential for the rider's performance is that the rider feels comfortable whilst riding the bicycle. Therefore the uncontrolled lateral dynamics and the required rider steer control input were investigated. The bicycle's geometry was optimized for low speed stability and the required control input. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to compare fascicle and tendon length of the gastrocnemius at the end of the eccentric phase during a hop utilizing a single countermovement (sCM) versus multiple countermovement (mCM1, mCM2, mCM3) strategy. Seventeen healthy males performed nine hopping trials of sCM and nine trials of mCM. Ankle and knee joint angle and lower leg length from videography and muscle ultrasound were used to calculate muscle-tendon unit (MTU), fascicle and tendon length. Sacral marker data was used to determine hopping height. Force- and displacement-time curves were utilized to calculate work. Muscle activity of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius was also measured. Fascicle length was significantly shorter (mCM3: 6.2 ± 1.5 cm, sCM: 7.3 ± 2.0 cm) and tendon length was significantly longer (mCM3: 36.5 ± 3.6 cm, sCM: 35.5 ± 3.8 cm) at the end of the eccentric phase in mCM3 in comparison to sCM. Maximal hopping height (mCM: 14.6 ± 3.1 cm, sCM: 13.1 ± 2.5 cm), eccentric phase gastrocnemius muscle activity (mCM medial gastrocnemius: 0.10 ± 0.03 mV, mCM lateral gastrocnemius: 0.08 ± 0.04 mV, sCM medial gastrocnemius: 0.07 ± 0.03 mV, sCM lateral gastrocnemius: 0.05 ± 0.04 mV), and both eccentric (mCM3: 46.6 ± 19.4 J, sCM: 38.5 ± 15.9 J) and concentric work (mCM3: 87.6 ± 26.5 J, sCM: 80.9 ± 27.6 J) were significantly higher for mCM3 compared to sCM. The results indicate that a multiple countermovement hop strategy results in shorter fascicle length and longer tendon length at the end of the eccentric phase. In addition, greater eccentric phase muscle activity during the third countermovement (mCM3) in comparison to a single countermovement hop (sCM) was observed. A multiple countermovement strategy appears to result in higher hopping height and greater work done in both the eccentric and concentric phase indicating possible contribution of stored-elastic energy from the tendon.},

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods were used to investigate the detailed airflow patterns around the cyclist for a constant velocity of 15 m/s without wind. The CFD simulations have focused on the aerodynamic drag effects in terms of wall shear stress maps and pressure coefficient distributions on the cyclist/helmet system. For a given head position, the helmet shape, by itself, obtained a weak effect on a cyclist's aerodynamic performance ({\textless}1.5{\%}). However, by varying head position, a cyclist significantly influences aerodynamic performance; the maximum difference between both positions being about 6.4{\%}. CFD results have also shown that both helmet shape and head position significantly influence drag forces, pressure and wall shear stress distributions on the whole cyclist's body due to the change in the near-wake behavior and in location of corresponding separation and attachment areas around the cyclist.},

@article{Lai2017,
abstract = {Traditional Hill-type muscle models, parameterized using high-quality experimental data, are often "too weak" to reproduce the joint torques generated by healthy adults during rapid, high force tasks. This study investigated whether the failure of these models to account for different types of motor units contributes to this apparent weakness; if so, muscle-driven simulations may rely on excessively high muscle excitations to generate a given force. We ran a series of forward simulations that reproduced measured ankle mechanics during cycling at five cadences ranging from 60 to 140 RPM. We generated both "nominal" simulations, in which an abstract ankle model was actuated by a 1-element Hill-type plantar flexor with a single contractile element (CE), and "test" simulations, in which the same model was actuated by a 2-element plantar flexor with two CEs that accounted for the force-generating properties of slower and faster motor units. We varied the total excitation applied to the 2-element plantar flexor between 60 and 105{\%} of the excitation from each nominal simulation, and we varied the amount distributed to each CE between 0 and 100{\%} of the total. Within this test space, we identified the excitation level and distribution, at each cadence, that best reproduced the plantar flexor forces generated in the nominal simulations. Our comparisons revealed that the 2-element model required substantially less total excitation than the 1-element model to generate comparable forces, especially at higher cadences. For instance, at 140 RPM, the required excitation was reduced by 23{\%}. These results suggest that a 2-element model, in which contractile properties are "tuned" to represent slower and faster motor units, can increase the apparent strength and perhaps improve the fidelity of simulations of tasks with varying mechanical demands.},

abstract = {A new procedure was developed for calculating power production during Olympic lifting movements and comparisons were made with a method previously used. The power output of seven superior lifters was determined during selected phases of the snatch, clean, and jerk, from films taken at the 1975 U.S. National Championships. The values obtained depended on the following variables: vertical change in the bar's mechanical energy from the beginning of a force exertion phase until maximum vertical bar velocity was achieved; work done by the athlete in producing horizontal bar movement; and work done in raising the body's center of gravity. Results showed the expected increase in power with increased bodyweight for a given movement. Values for the jerk drive ranged from 2140 watts in the 56 kg class to 4786 watts for a 110 kg lifter. Heavier lifters exceeded published maximal estimates for human power output during brief exertions. More significant was the high degree of consistency in the rate of work done by any given lifter in movements which were very similar with respect to joint action, but competitively had very different objectives. The procedure should prove useful in detecting problems in lifting movements that result in power outputs which are low relative to those measured for biomechanically equivalent exertions.},

Twenty athletes performed an incremental cycling test to determine their power output (POMAX and POVT2; first session) and pedal forces, muscle activation, muscle-tendon unit length, and vastus lateralis architecture (fascicle length, pennation angle, and muscle thickness) were recorded (second session) in POMAX and POVT2. Athletes were assigned to two clusters based on the behaviour of outcome variables at POVT2 and POMAX using cluster analysis. Clusters {\#}1 (n=14) and {\#}2 (n=6) showed similar power output and oxygen uptake. Cluster {\#}1 presented larger increases in pedal force and knee power than Cluster {\#}2, without differences for the index of effectiveness. Cluster {\#}1 presented less variation in knee angle, muscle-tendon unit length, pennation angle and tendon length compared to Cluster {\#}2. However, Clusters {\#}1 and {\#}2 showed similar muscle thickness, fascicle length and muscle activation. When cycling at POVT2 versus POMAX, cyclists could opt for keeping a constant knee power and pedal force production, associated with an increase in tendon excursion and a constant fascicle length. In conclusion, increases in power output lead to greater variations in knee angle, muscle-tendon unit length, tendon length, and pennation angle of vastus lateralis for a similar knee extensor activation and smaller pedal force changes in cyclists from Cluster {\#}2 compared to Cluster {\#}1.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine the effects of moderate load exercise with and without blood flow restriction on strength, power and repeated sprint ability, along with acute and chronic salivary hormonal parameters. Methods: Twenty male semi-professional rugby union athletes were randomized to a lower-body blood flow restricted intervention (an occlusion cuff inflated to 180 mmHg worn intermittently on the proximal thighs) or a control intervention that trained without occlusion in a cross-over design. Experimental sessions were performed three times a week for three weeks with 5 sets of 5 repetitions of bench press, leg squat and pull-ups performed at 70{\%} of 1-repetition maximum. Results: Greater improvements were observed (occlusion training vs control) in bench press (5.4±2.6 vs 3.3±1.4kg), squat (7.8±2.1 vs 4.3±1.4kg), maximum sprint time (-0.03±0.03 vs -0.01±0.02s) and leg power (168±105 vs 68±50W). Greater exercise-induced salivary testosterone (Effect Size: 0.84 to 0.61) and cortisol responses (ES: 0.65 to 0.20) were observed following the occlusion intervention sessions compared to the non-occluded controls; however the acute cortisol increases were attenuated across the training block.. Conclusions: Occlusion training can potentially improve the rate of strength training gains and fatigue resistance in trained athletes, possibly allowing greater gains from lower loading which could be of benefit during high training loads, in competitive seasons, or in a rehabilitative setting. The clear improvement in bench press strength resulting from lower-body occlusion suggests a systemic effect of blood flow restricted training.},

abstract = {Three different cyclist positions were evaluated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and wind-tunnel experiments were used to provide reliable data to evaluate the accuracy of the CFD simulations. Specific features of this study are: (1) both steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and unsteady flow modelling, with more advanced turbulence modelling techniques (Large-Eddy Simulation - LES), were evaluated; (2) the boundary layer on the cyclist's surface was resolved entirely with low-Reynolds number modelling, instead of modelling it with wall functions; (3) apart from drag measurements, also surface pressure measurements on the cyclist's body were performed in the wind-tunnel experiment, which provided the basis for a more detailed evaluation of the predicted flow field by CFD. The results show that the simulated and measured drag areas differed about 11{\%} (RANS) and 7{\%} (LES), which is considered to be a close agreement in CFD studies. A fair agreement with wind-tunnel data was obtained for the predicted surface pressures, especially with LES. Despite the higher accuracy of LES, its much higher computational cost could make RANS more attractive for practical use in some situations. CFD is found to be a valuable tool to evaluate the drag of different cyclist positions and to investigate the influence of small adjustments in the cyclist's position. A strong advantage of CFD is that detailed flow field information is obtained, which cannot easily be obtained from wind-tunnel tests. This detailed information allows more insight in the causes of the drag force and provides better guidance for position improvements. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We aim to summarise the impact and mechanisms of work-rate pacing during individual cycling time trials (TTs). Unlike time-to-exhaustion tests, a TT provides an externally valid model for examining how an initial work rate is chosen and maintained by an athlete during self-selected exercise. The selection and distribution of work rate is one of many factors that influence cycling speed. Mathematical models are available to predict the impact of factors such as gradient and wind velocity on cycling speed, but only a few researchers have examined the inter-relationships between these factors and work-rate distribution within a TT. When environmental conditions are relatively stable (e.g. in a velodrome) and the TT is {\textgreater}10 minutes, then an even distribution of work rate is optimal. For a shorter TT (≤10 minutes), work rate should be increased during the starting effort because this proportion of total race time is significant. For a very short TT (≤2 minutes), the starting effort should be maximal, since the time saved during the starting phase is predicted to outweigh any time lost during the final metres because of fatigue. A similar 'time saving' rationale underpins the advice that work rate should vary in parallel with any changes in gradient or wind speed during a road TT. Increasing work rate in headwind and uphill sections, and vice versa, decreases the variability in speed and, therefore, the total race time. It seems that even experienced cyclists naturally select a supraoptimal work rate at the start of a longer TT. Whether such a start can be 'blunted' through coaching or the monitoring of psychophysiological variables is unknown. Similarly, the extent to which cyclists can vary and monitor work rate during a TT is unclear. There is evidence that sub-elite cyclists can vary work rate by ±5{\%} the average for a TT lasting 25-60 minutes, but such variability might be difficult with high-performance cyclists whose average work rate during a TT is already extremely high ({\textgreater}350 watts). During a TT, pacing strategy is regulated in a complex anticipatory system that monitors afferent feedback from various physiological systems, and then regulates the work rate so that potentially limiting changes do not occur before the endpoint of exercise is reached. It is critical that the endpoint of exercise is known by the cyclist so that adjustments to exercise work rate can be made within the context of an estimated finish time. Pacing strategies are thus the consequence of complex regulation and serve a dual role: they are both the result of homeostatic regulation by the brain, as well as being the means by which such regulation is achieved. The pacing strategy 'algorithm' is sited in the brain and would need afferent input from interoceptors, such as heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as exteroceptors providing information on local environmental conditions. Such inputs have been shown to induce activity in the thalamus, hypothalamus and the parietal somatosensory cortex. Knowledge of time, modulated by the cerebellum, basal ganglia and primary somatosensory cortex, would also input to the pacing algorithm as would information stored in memory about previous similar exercise bouts. How all this information is assimilated by the different regions of the brain is not known at present. {\textcopyright} 2007 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.},

A motion analysis system and a custom instrumented pedal were used to collect five cycles of three-dimensional kinematics (240 Hz) and pedal reaction force (PRF, 1200 Hz) during 2 min of cycling in each of eight testing conditions, including five workload conditions of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 kg at 60 rpm, and three cadence conditions of 70, 80, and 90 rpm with 1-kg workload. Two one-way repeated measures analyses of variance were used to examine the influence of cadence and workload on selected variables (P {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Increased workloads with constant rpm caused an increased peak knee abduction moment from 5.82 to 14.36 N{\textperiodcentered}m and peak knee extension moment from 11.61 to 37.16 N{\textperiodcentered}m. Increased workloads also significantly increased peak medial and vertical PRF. Increased cadences at the constant workload had no effects on peak knee abduction moment but caused increased peak anterior and vertical PRF and peak knee flexion moment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that increasing workload at constant cadence significantly increased peak knee abduction moment. Further study may be needed to demonstrate the efficacy of appropriate levels of workload and cadence in knee osteoarthritis and other populations with knee problems.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Biomechanics and motor control are discussed as parts of a more general science, physics of living systems. Major problems of biomechanics deal with exact definition of variables and their experimental measurement. In motor control, major problems are associated with formulating currently unknown laws of nature specific for movements by biological objects. Mechanics-based hypotheses in motor control, such as those originating from notions of a generalized motor program and internal models, are non-physical. The famous problem of motor redundancy is wrongly formulated; it has to be replaced by the principle of abundance, which does not pose computational problems for the central nervous system. Biomechanical methods play a central role in motor control studies. This is illustrated with studies with the reconstruction of hypothetical control variables and those exploring motor synergies within the framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis. Biomechanics and motor control have to merge into physics of living systems, and the earlier this process starts the better.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {When investigating the dynamics of three-dimensional multi-body biomechanical systems it is often difficult to derive spatiotemporally directed predictions regarding experimentally induced effects. A paradigm of 'non-directed' hypothesis testing has emerged in the literature as a result. Non-directed analyses typically consist of ad hoc scalar extraction, an approach which substantially simplifies the original, highly multivariate datasets (many time points, many vector components). This paper describes a commensurately multivariate method as an alternative to scalar extraction. The method, called 'statistical parametric mapping' (SPM), uses random field theory to objectively identify field regions which co-vary significantly with the experimental design. We compared SPM to scalar extraction by re-analyzing three publicly available datasets: 3D knee kinematics, a ten-muscle force system, and 3D ground reaction forces. Scalar extraction was found to bias the analyses of all three datasets by failing to consider sufficient portions of the dataset, and/or by failing to consider covariance amongst vector components. SPM overcame both problems by conducting hypothesis testing at the (massively multivariate) vector trajectory level, with random field corrections simultaneously accounting for temporal correlation and vector covariance. While SPM has been widely demonstrated to be effective for analyzing 3D scalar fields, the current results are the first to demonstrate its effectiveness for 1D vector field analysis. It was concluded that SPM offers a generalized, statistically comprehensive solution to scalar extraction's over-simplification of vector trajectories, thereby making it useful for objectively guiding analyses of complex biomechanical systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Interindividual variation in running and cycling exercise economy (EE) remains unexplained although studied for more than a century. This study is the first to comprehensively evaluate the importance of biochemical, structural, physiological, anthropometric, and biomechanical influences on running and cycling EE within a single study. In 22 healthy males (VO2 max range 45.5-72.1 mL{\textperiodcentered}min(-1) {\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) ), no factor related to skeletal muscle structure ({\%} slow-twitch fiber content, number of capillaries per fiber), mitochondrial properties (volume density, oxidative capacity, or mitochondrial efficiency), or protein content (UCP3 and MFN2 expression) explained variation in cycling and running EE among subjects. In contrast, biomechanical variables related to vertical displacement correlated well with running EE, but were not significant when taking body weight into account. Thus, running EE and body weight were correlated (R(2) =.94; P{\textless}.001), but was lower for cycling EE (R(2) =.23; P{\textless}.023). To separate biomechanical determinants of running EE, we contrasted individual running and cycling EE considering that during cycle ergometer exercise, the biomechanical influence on EE would be small because of the fixed movement pattern. Differences in cycling and running exercise protocols, for example, related to biomechanics, play however only a secondary role in determining EE. There was no evidence for an impact of structural or functional skeletal muscle variables on EE. Body weight was the main determinant of EE explaining 94{\%} of variance in running EE, although more than 50{\%} of the variability of cycling EE remains unexplained.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine physiological responses to two different simulated firefighting exercises: a firefighting exercise with flashovers, smoke, poor visibility and extreme temperatures (300°) in a burning container and a standard firefighting exercise in temperate conditions. Furthermore, a second purpose of the study was to find out if the contribution of strength and endurance capacities to firefighting performance changes when the demands of the firefighting exercise change. Methods: Sixteen professional firefighters performed a maximum treadmill test, strength testing, a standard simulated firefighting exercise (SFE) without heat and flashovers and a firefighting exercise with a simulation of the flashover phenomenon in a burning container (FOT). The treadmill testing was used to determine peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), ventilatory threshold (VT1) and respiratory compensation point (RCP). Three intensity zones were identified according to heart rate (HR) values corresponding to VT1 and RCP: zone 1–HR below VT1, zone 2-HR between VT1 and RCP, zone 3–HR above RCP. Firefighting performance was determined by a simple time-strain-air depletion model (TSA) taking the sum of z-transformed parameters of time to finish the exercise, strain in terms of mean heart rate, and air depletion from the breathing apparatus. Correlations were then established between TSA based firefighting performance parameters and fitness variables representing strength and endurance. Results: HR was significantly lower during SFE (79.9±6.9 {\%}HRmax) compared to FOT (85.4±5.2 {\%}HRmax). During SFE subjects spent 24.6±30.2 {\%} of time in zone 1, 65.8±28.1 {\%} in zone 2 and 9.7±16.6 {\%} in zone 3. During FOT subjects spent 16.3±12.8 {\%} in zone 1, 50.4±13.2 {\%} in zone 2 and 33.3±16.6 {\%} in zone 3. Out of all correlations, relative VO2peak showed the highest relation to mean HR during SFE (-.593) as well as FOT (-.693). Conclusions: Endurance in terms of VO2peak is an important prerequisite for both firefighting exercises. However, for standard simulated firefighting exercises it is important to work below VT1. For firefighting exercises in extreme temperatures with smoke, poor visibility and unexpected flashovers a high fitness level is required in order to keep the time spent above RCP as short as possible.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Many patients who sustain an acute lateral ankle sprain develop chronic ankle instability (CAI). Altered ankle kinematics have been reported to play a role in the underlying mechanisms of CAI. In previous studies, however, the foot was modeled as one rigid segment, ignoring the complexity of the ankle and foot anatomy and kinematics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate stance phase kinematics of subjects with CAI, copers, and controls during walking and running using both a rigid and a multisegmented foot model. METHODS: Foot and ankle kinematics of 77 subjects (29 subjects with self-reported CAI, 24 copers, and 24 controls) were measured during barefoot walking and running using a rigid foot model and a six-segment Ghent Foot Model. Data were collected on a 20-m-long instrumented runway embedded with a force plate and a six-camera optoelectronic system. Groups were compared using statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: Both the CAI and the coper group showed similar differences during midstance and late stance compared with the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). The rigid foot segment showed a more everted position during walking compared with the control group. Based on the Ghent Foot Model, the rear foot also showed a more everted position during running. The medial forefoot showed a more inverted position for both running and walking compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed significant midstance and late stance differences in rigid foot, rear foot, and medial forefoot kinematics The multisegmented foot model demonstrated intricate behavior of the foot that is not detectable with rigid foot modeling. Further research using these models is necessary to expand knowledge of foot kinematics in subjects with CAI.},

abstract = {Background: Side cutting involves mechanical loading of the knee which has been associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury risk. Despite a fast growing body of research, the relationship between loading mechanisms and running speed is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate how running speed determines a likely trade-off between task achievement and actual mechanical loading. Methods: Fourteen female participants (mean age=20.6±0.7yr, height=1.66±0.05m, mass=57.5±6.9kg) performed 45° side cutting manoeuvres at 2, 3, 4 and 5ms-1approach speeds. Three dimensional motion and ground reaction forces were recorded to calculate whole body centre of mass (CoM) velocity and lower limb kinematics and kinetics, focusing on knee flexion angle at touch-down and peak knee valgus loading during weight acceptance. One-way repeated measures ANOVA and one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping were used to identify significant speed effects on task achievement and mechanical loading. Results: Analysis of CoM velocities revealed that side cutting manoeuvres at higher running speeds matched the task requirements to a lesser extent. Despite a gradual increase of anterior-posterior deceleration and medio-lateral acceleration with running speed, knee loading mechanisms only reached meaningful levels from a 4ms-1running speed. Conclusion: Our results confirmed a trade-off between task achievement and actual mechanical loading. This identified a need for standardisation of reporting running speeds. Taking into account also safety considerations, standardisation of a 4ms-1running speed is proposed for female athletes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine whether using a direct kinematic (DK) or inverse kinematic (IK) modeling approach could influence the estimation of knee joint kinematics, kinetics, and ACL injury risk classification during unanticipated side cutting. METHODS: The three-dimensional motion and force data of 34 amateur Australian rules footballers conducting unanticipated side-cutting maneuvers were collected. The model used during the DK modeling approach was an eight-segment lower body model with the hip, knee, and ankle free to move in six degrees of freedom. During the IK modeling approach, the same eight-segment model was used; however, translational constraints were imposed on the hip, knee, and ankle joints. The similarity between kinematic and kinetic waveforms was evaluated using the root mean square difference (RMSD) and the one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping (SPM1D). The classification of an athlete's ACL injury risk was determined by correlating their peak knee moments with a predefined injury risk threshold. RESULTS: The greatest RMSD occurred in the frontal plane joint angles (RMSD = 10.86°) and moments (RMSD = 0.67 ± 0.18 N{\textperiodcentered}m{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)), which were also shown to be significantly different throughout the stance phase in the SPM1D analysis. Both DK and IK modeling approaches classified the same athletes as being at risk of ACL injury. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of a DK or an IK modeling approach affected frontal plane estimates of knee joint angles and peak knee moments during the weight acceptance phase of unanticipated side cutting. However, both modeling approaches were similar in their classification of an athlete's ACL injury risk.},

abstract = {Impairment of the human neuromusculoskeletal system can lead to significant mobility limitations and decreased quality of life. Computational models that accurately represent the musculoskeletal systems of individual patients could be used to explore different treatment options and optimize clinical outcome. The most significant barrier to model-based treatment design is validation of model-based estimates of in vivo contact and muscle forces. This paper introduces an annual "Grand Challenge Competition to Predict In Vivo Knee Loads" based on a series of comprehensive publicly available in vivo data sets for evaluating musculoskeletal model predictions of contact and muscle forces in the knee. The data sets come from patients implanted with force-measuring tibial prostheses. Following a historical review of musculoskeletal modeling methods used for estimating knee muscle and contact forces, we describe the first two data sets used for the first two competitions and summarize four subsequent data sets to be used for future competitions. These data sets include tibial contact force, video motion, ground reaction, muscle EMG, muscle strength, static and dynamic imaging, and implant geometry data. Competition participants create musculoskeletal models to predict tibial contact forces without having access to the corresponding in vivo measurements. These blinded predictions provide an unbiased evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of musculoskeletal modeling methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of how these unique data sets can be used by the musculoskeletal modeling research community to improve the estimation of in vivo muscle and contact forces and ultimately to help make musculoskeletal models clinically useful.},

abstract = {Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, and Zurich – the largest cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland – have significantly reduced the car share of trips over the past 25 years in spite of high motorisation rates. The key to their success has been a coordinated package of mutually reinforcing transport and land- use policies that have made car use slower, less convenient, and more costly, while increasing the safety, convenience, and feasibility of walking, cycling, and public transport. The mix of policies implemented in each city has been somewhat different. The German cities have done far more to promote cycling, while Zurich and Vienna offer more public transport service per capita at lower fares. All five of the cities have implemented roughly the same policies to promote walking, foster compact mixed-use development, and discourage car use. Of the car-restrictive policies, parking management has been by far the most important. The five case study cities demonstrate that it is possible to reduce car dependence even in affluent societies with high levels of car ownership and high expectations for quality of travel.},

abstract = {In cycling stage races a small group of riders will often form a "breakaway" and establish a lead over the main group. This paper examines the factors that affect the likelihood of success for the breakaway. A mathematical approach is used, drawing on a model of cycling previously developed and validated (Olds et al. J Appl Physiol 78:1596 1611, 1995). In a breakaway group, the power required to overcome air resistance is reduced because the lead can be shared, with trailing riders sheltering or drafting behind leading riders. The benefit of drafting can be quantified as a function of the distance between riders using previously obtained data. Of course, this advantage is even greater in the (larger) chasing group, so that eventually the chasing group will catch the breakaway, assuming identical bicycles and physiological characteristics. The question addressed is: what factors determine how great a lead the breakaway must have in order for the chasing group to be unable to catch the breakaway before the finish of the race? Demand-side simulations show that the critical factors are: the distance remaining in the race; the speed of the breakaway group; the number of riders in the chasing and breakaway groups: how closely riders in each group draft one another; the grade; surface roughness; as well as head- and cross-winds. When supply-side physiological factors are incorporated, the maximum sustainable speed and maximum lead time can be calculated.},

abstract = {The objective of the research described in this article was to evaluate the perception of a group of individuals with respect to barriers that may hinder the use of bicycles for commuting. Data collection was carried out with 380 college students in three Brazilian cities. In order to assess the perception of barriers, a questionnaire, based on the dimensions of the Theory of Planned Behavior, was prepared. The selection of the barriers to be used in the survey was made after a review of several papers published in referenced periodicals and included: lack of cycling infrastructure, lack of safety, distance to be travelled, physical fitness, slopes and climate. The results show that the strongest perceived barrier (smallest behavioral control) in all three cities is the lack of dedicated cycling infrastructure. This result emphasizes how important an adequate cycling network is for encouraging and increasing the use of bicycles for commuting. The analysis of the size of cities versus the perceived behavioral control revealed that the larger the city the lower the level of behavioral control (stronger barriers).},

First, sector-related variables were specified using expert opinions and a literature survey. Relationships between the variables and the associated intensity values were then identified using document coding, as well as by gathering expert opinions through a workshop. A fuzzy cognitive map analysis was then conducted to investigate the relationships between the variables and the resulting impacts by the transportation sector on climate change. A scenario analysis was also conducted in order to identify the most effective policies in reducing the impacts of transportation on climate change, at both the local and global levels. For the scenario analysis at the global level, projections by the International Energy Agency were analyzed through the model. The local policy suggestions developed by Turkish authorities were also evaluated using scenario analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Little epidemiological information exists on overuse injuries in elite road cyclists. Anecdotal reports indicate anterior knee pain and lower back pain may be common problems. PURPOSE This study was conducted to register overuse injuries among professional road cyclists with special focus on anterior knee and lower back pain. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS We attended training camps of 7 professional teams and interviewed 109 of 116 cyclists (94{\%}) on overuse injuries they had experienced in the previous 12 months. Injuries that required attention from medical personnel or involved time loss from cycling were registered. Additional information on anterior knee pain and lower back pain was collected using specific questionnaires. RESULTS A total of 94 injuries were registered; 45{\%} were in the lower back and 23{\%} in the knee. Twenty-three time-loss injuries were registered-57{\%} in the knee, 22{\%} in the lower back, and 13{\%} in the lower leg. Fifty-eight percent of all cyclists had experienced lower back pain in the previous 12 months, and 41{\%} of all cyclists had sought medical attention for it. Thirty-six percent had experienced anterior knee pain and 19{\%} had sought medical attention for it. Few cyclists had missed competitions because of pain in the lower back (6{\%}) or anterior knee (9{\%}). CONCLUSION Lower back pain and anterior knee pain were the most prevalent overuse injuries, with knee injuries most likely to cause time loss and lower back pain causing the highest rates of functional impairment and medical attention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Future efforts to prevent overuse injuries in competitive cyclists should focus on lower back pain and anterior knee pain.},

abstract = {Choice of pacing strategy and the benefit of aerodynamic drafting are thought to be key determinants of racing performance. These effects have largely been analysed without reference to final outcome, in small datasets with low temporal resolution, and a focus on human swimming, cycling and running. Here, we determined the position and speed of 44,803 racehorses, once per second, in 3,357 races ranging in length from 1006 to 4225 m (50.9-292.9 seconds duration) using a validated radio tracking system. We find that aerodynamic drafting has a marked effect on horse performance, and hence racing outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that race length-dependent pacing strategies are correlated with the fastest racing times, with some horses reaching a maximum speed in excess of 19 m s(-1). The higher speeds seen with certain pacing strategies may arise due to the nature of pack racing itself, or may be a reflection of individual capabilities, that is, corresponding to horses that perform well in roles suited to their 'front-running' or 'chaser' personality traits.},

abstract = {Choice of pacing strategy and the benefit of aerodynamic drafting are thought to be key determinants of racing performance. These effects have largely been analysed without reference to final outcome, in small datasets with low temporal resolution, and a focus on human swimming, cycling and running. Here, we determined the position and speed of 44,803 racehorses, once per second, in 3,357 races ranging in length from 1006 to 4225 m (50.9-292.9 seconds duration) using a validated radio tracking system. We find that aerodynamic drafting has a marked effect on horse performance, and hence racing outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that race length-dependent pacing strategies are correlated with the fastest racing times, with some horses reaching a maximum speed in excess of 19 m s(-1). The higher speeds seen with certain pacing strategies may arise due to the nature of pack racing itself, or may be a reflection of individual capabilities, that is, corresponding to horses that perform well in roles suited to their 'front-running' or 'chaser' personality traits.},

abstract = {Injury aetiology models that have evolved over the previous two decades highlight a number of factors which contribute to the causal mechanisms for athletic injuries. These models highlight the pathway to injury, including (1) internal risk factors (eg, age, neuromuscular control) which predispose athletes to injury, (2) exposure to external risk factors (eg, playing surface, equipment), and finally (3) an inciting event, wherein biomechanical breakdown and injury occurs. The most recent aetiological model proposed in 2007 was the first to detail the dynamic nature of injury risk, whereby participation may or may not result in injury, and participation itself alters injury risk through adaptation. However, although training and competition workloads are strongly associated with injury, existing aetiology models neither include them nor provide an explanation for how workloads alter injury risk. Therefore, we propose an updated injury aetiology model which includes the effects of workloads. Within this model, internal risk factors are differentiated into modifiable and non-modifiable factors, and workloads contribute to injury in three ways: (1) exposure to external risk factors and potential inciting events, (2) fatigue, or negative physiological effects, and (3) fitness, or positive physiological adaptations. Exposure is determined solely by total load, while positive and negative adaptations are controlled both by total workloads, as well as changes in load (eg, the acute:chronic workload ratio). Finally, we describe how this model explains the load-injury relationships for total workloads, acute:chronic workload ratios and the training load-injury paradox.},

abstract = {Many athletes, coaches, and support staff are taking an increasingly scientific approach to both designing and monitoring training programs. Appropriate load monitoring can aid in determining whether an athlete is adapting to a training program and in minimizing the risk of developing non-functional overreaching, illness, and/or injury. In order to gain an understanding of the training load and its effect on the athlete, a number of potential markers are available for use. However, very few of these markers have strong scientific evidence supporting their use, and there is yet to be a single, definitive marker described in the literature. Research has investigated a number of external load quantifying and monitoring tools, such as power output measuring devices, time-motion analysis, as well as internal load unit measures, including perception of effort, heart rate, blood lactate, and training impulse. Dissociation between external and internal load units may reveal the state of fatigue of an athlete. Other monitoring tools used by high-performance programs include heart rate recovery, neuromuscular function, biochemical/hormonal/immunological assessments, questionnaires and diaries, psychomotor speed, and sleep quality and quantity. The monitoring approach taken with athletes may depend on whether the athlete is engaging in individual or team sport activity; however, the importance of individualization of load monitoring cannot be over emphasized. Detecting meaningful changes with scientific and statistical approaches can provide confidence and certainty when implementing change. Appropriate monitoring of training load can provide important information to athletes and coaches; however, monitoring systems should be intuitive, provide efficient data analysis and interpretation, and enable efficient reporting of simple, yet scientifically valid, feedback.},

@article{Gabbett2016,
abstract = {Background There is dogma that higher training load causes higher injury rates. However, there is also evidence that training has a protective effect against injury. For example, team sport athletes who performed more than 18 weeks of training before sustaining their initial injuries were at reduced risk of sustaining a subsequent injury, while high chronic workloads have been shown to decrease the risk of injury. Second, across a wide range of sports, well-developed physical qualities are associated with a reduced risk of injury. Clearly, for athletes to develop the physical capacities required to provide a protective effect against injury, they must be prepared to train hard. Finally, there is also evidence that under-training may increase injury risk. Collectively, these results emphasise that reductions in workloads may not always be the best approach to protect against injury. Main thesis This paper describes the 'Training-Injury Prevention Paradox' model; a phenomenon whereby athletes accustomed to high training loads have fewer injuries than athletes training at lower workloads. The Model is based on evidence that non-contact injuries are not caused by training per se, but more likely by an inappropriate training programme. Excessive and rapid increases in training loads are likely responsible for a large proportion of non-contact, soft-tissue injuries. If training load is an important determinant of injury, it must be accurately measured up to twice daily and over periods of weeks and months (a season). This paper outlines ways of monitoring training load ('internal' and 'external' loads) and suggests capturing both recent ('acute') training loads and more medium-term ('chronic') training loads to best capture the player's training burden. I describe the critical variable—acute: chronic workload ratio)—as a best practice predictor of training-related injuries. This provides the foundation for interventions to reduce players risk, and thus, time-loss injuries. Summary The appropriately graded prescription of high training loads should improve players' fitness, which in turn may protect against injury, ultimately leading to (1) greater physical outputs and resilience in competition, and (2) a greater proportion of the squad available for selection each week. TRAINING–PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP In a British Journal of Sports Medicine blog, Dr John Orchard 1 proposed hypothetical relationships between training (both under-training and over-training), injury, fitness and performance. He speculated that both inadequate and excessive train-ing loads would result in increased injuries, reduced fitness and poor team performance (see figure 1). The relationship between training load, injury, fitness and performance is critical to sports medicine/physiotherapy and sport science practi-tioners. In this paper I use the term 'practitioners' to refer to the wide gamut of health professionals and also sport scientists who work with athletes/ teams (ie, strength and conditioning coaches, certi-fied personal trainers, etc). Our field—sports per-formance and sports injury prevention is a multidisciplinary one and this paper is relevant to the field broadly. Injuries impair team performance, but any injur-ies that could potentially be considered 'training load-related' are commonly viewed as 'preventable', and therefore the domain of the sport science and medicine team. Sport science (including strength and conditioning) and sports medicine (including doctors and physiotherapists) practitioners share a common goal of keeping players injury free. Sport science and strength and conditioning staff aim to develop resilience through exposing players to physically intense training to prepare players for the physical demands of competition, including the most demanding passages of play. On the other hand, doctors and physiotherapists are often viewed as the staff responsible for 'man-aging players away from injury'. A stereotype is the physiotherapist or doctor advocating to reduce training loads so that fewer players will succumb to 'load-related' (eg, overuse) injuries. However, how many of the decisions governing players and their individual training loads are based on empirical evi-dence or the practitioners' 'expert' intuition (ie, 'gut feel')? Banister et al 2 proposed that the performance of an athlete in response to training can be estimated from the difference between a negative function ('fatigue') and a positive function ('fitness'). The ideal training stimulus 'sweet spot' is the one that maximises net performance potential by having an appropriate training load while limiting the nega-tive consequences of training (ie, injury, illness, fatigue and overtraining).},

abstract = {Why is maximal running speed reduced on curved paths? The leading explanation proposes that an increase in lateral ground reaction force necessitates a decrease in peak vertical ground reaction force, assuming that maximum leg extension force is the limiting factor. Yet, no studies have directly measured these forces or tested this critical assumption. We measured maximum sprint velocities and ground reaction forces for five male humans sprinting along a straight track and compared them to sprints along circular tracks of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 m radii. Circular track sprint trials were performed either with or without a tether that applied centripetal force to the center of mass. Sprinters generated significantly smaller peak resultant ground reaction forces during normal curve sprinting compared to straight sprinting. This provides direct evidence against the idea that maximum leg extension force is always achieved and is the limiting factor. Use of the tether increased sprint speed, but not to expected values. During curve sprinting, the inside leg consistently generated smaller peak forces compared to the outside leg. Several competing biomechanical constraints placed on the stance leg during curve sprinting likely make the inside leg particularly ineffective at generating the ground reaction forces necessary to attain maximum velocities comparable to straight path sprinting. The ability of quadrupeds to redistribute function across multiple stance legs and decouple these multiple constraints may provide a distinct advantage for turning performance.},

Adaptations for acceleration and deceleration are therefore likely to experience strong selective pressures--both natural and artificial. Here, we explore the mechanical and physiological constraints to acceleration. We examined two elite athletes bred and trained for acceleration performance (polo ponies and racing greyhounds), when performing maximal acceleration (and deceleration for ponies) in a competitive setting. We show that maximum acceleration and deceleration ability may be accounted for by two simple limits, one mechanical and one physiological. At low speed, acceleration and deceleration may be limited by the geometric constraints of avoiding net nose-up or tail-up pitching, respectively. At higher speeds, muscle power appears to limit acceleration.},

@article{Roberts2002,
abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that the hindlimb muscles of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) can produce maximal power during running accelerations. The mechanical power developed during single running steps was calculated from force-plate and high-speed video measurements as turkeys accelerated over a trackway. Steady-speed running steps and accelerations were compared to determine how turkeys alter their running mechanics from a low-power to a high-power gait. During maximal accelerations, turkeys eliminated two features of running mechanics that are characteristic of steady-speed running: (i) they produced purely propulsive horizontal ground reaction forces, with no braking forces, and (ii) they produced purely positive work during stance, with no decrease in the mechanical energy of the body during the step. The braking and propulsive forces ordinarily developed during steady-speed running are important for balance because they align the ground reaction force vector with the center of mass. Increases in acceleration in turkeys correlated with decreases in the angle of limb protraction at toe-down and increases in the angle of limb retraction at toe-off. These kinematic changes allow turkeys to maintain the alignment of the center of mass and ground reaction force vector during accelerations when large propulsive forces result in a forward-directed ground reaction force. During the highest accelerations, turkeys produced exclusively positive mechanical power. The measured power output during acceleration divided by the total hindlimb muscle mass yielded estimates of peak instantaneous power output in excess of 400 W kg-1 hindlimb muscle mass. This value exceeds estimates of peak instantaneous power output of turkey muscle fibers. The mean power developed during the entire stance phase increased from approximately zero during steady-speed runs to more than 150 W kg-1 muscle during the highest accelerations. The high power outputs observed during accelerations suggest that elastic energy storage and recovery may redistribute muscle power during acceleration. Elastic mechanisms may expand the functional range of muscle contractile elements in running animals by allowing muscles to vary their mechanical function from force-producing struts during steady-speed running to power-producing motors during acceleration.},

abstract = {In 1969, a palaeontologist proposed that theropod dinosaurs used their tails as dynamic stabilizers during rapid or irregular movements, contributing to their depiction as active and agile predators. Since then the inertia of swinging appendages has been implicated in stabilizing human walking, aiding acrobatic manoeuvres by primates and rodents, and enabling cats to balance on branches. Recent studies on geckos suggest that active tail stabilization occurs during climbing, righting and gliding. By contrast, studies on the effect of lizard tail loss show evidence of a decrease, an increase or no change in performance. Application of a control-theoretic framework could advance our general understanding of inertial appendage use in locomotion. Here we report that lizards control the swing of their tails in a measured manner to redirect angular momentum from their bodies to their tails, stabilizing body attitude in the sagittal plane. We video-recorded Red-Headed Agama lizards (Agama agama) leaping towards a vertical surface by first vaulting onto an obstacle with variable traction to induce a range of perturbations in body angular momentum. To examine a known controlled tail response, we built a lizard-sized robot with an active tail that used sensory feedback to stabilize pitch as it drove off a ramp. Our dynamics model revealed that a body swinging its tail experienced less rotation than a body with a rigid tail, a passively compliant tail or no tail. To compare a range of tails, we calculated tail effectiveness as the amount of tailless body rotation a tail could stabilize. A model Velociraptor mongoliensis supported the initial tail stabilization hypothesis, showing as it did a greater tail effectiveness than the Agama lizards. Leaping lizards show that inertial control of body attitude can advance our understanding of appendage evolution and provide biological inspiration for the next generation of manoeuvrable search-and-rescue robots.},

abstract = {As red kangaroos hop faster over level ground, their rate of oxygen consumption (indicating metabolic energy consumption) remains nearly the same. This phenomenon has been attributed to exceptional elastic energy storage and recovery via long compliant tendons in the legs. Alternatively, red kangaroos may have exceptionally efficient muscles. To estimate efficiency, we measured the metabolic cost of uphill hopping, where muscle fibers must perform mechanical work against gravity. We found that uphill hopping was much more expensive than level hopping. The maximal rate of oxygen consumption measured (3 ml O2kg-1s-1) exceeds all but a few vertebrate species. However, efficiency values were normal, {\~{}}30{\%}. At faster level hopping speeds the effective mechanical advantage of the extensor muscles of the ankle joint remained the same. Thus, kangaroos generate the same muscular force at all speeds but do so more rapidly at faster hopping speeds. This contradicts a recent hypothesis for what sets the cost of locomotion. The cost of transport (J kg-1m-1) decreases at faster hopping speeds, yet red kangaroos prefer to use relatively slow speeds that avoid high levels of tendon stress.

@article{Robertson2018,
abstract = {The objective was to better understand how a series compliance alters contraction kinetics and power output of muscle to enhance the work done on a load. A mathematical model was created in which a gravitational point load was connected via a linear spring to a muscle (based on the contractile properties of the sartorius of leopard frogs, Rana pipiens). The model explored the effects of load mass, tendon compliance, and delay between onset of contraction and release of the load (catch) on lift height and power output as measures of performance. Series compliance resulted in increased lift height over a relatively narrow range of compliances, and the effect was quite modest without an imposed catch mechanism unless the load was unrealistically small. Peak power of the muscle-tendon complex could be augmented up to four times that produced with a muscle alone, however, lift height was not predicted by peak power. Rather, lift height was improved as a result of the compliance synchronizing the time courses of muscle force and shortening velocity, in particular by stabilizing shortening velocity such that muscle power was sustained rather than rising and immediately falling. With a catch mechanism, enhanced performance resulted largely from energy storage in the compliance during the period of catch, rather than increased time for muscle activation before movement commenced. However, series compliance introduced a trade-off between work done before versus after release of the catch. Thus, the ability of tendons to enhance locomotor performance (i.e. increase the work done by muscle) appears dependent not only on their established role in storing energy and increasing power, but also on their ability to modulate the kinetics of muscle contraction such that power is sustained over more of the contraction, and maximizing the balance of work done before versus after release of a catch.},

@article{Galantis2003,
abstract = {When a muscle delivers power to an inertial load through a spring, the peak power can exceed the maximum that the muscle alone could produce. Using normalized differential equations relating dimensionless quantities we show, by solving the equations either analytically or numerically, that one dimensionless constant (Xi), representing the inertial load, is sufficient to specify the behaviour during shortening of a muscle-tendon complex with linear force-velocity and force-extension properties. In the presence of gravity, an additional constant (Gamma), representing the gravitational acceleration, is required. Nonlinear force-velocity and force-extension relationships each introduce an additional constant, representing their curvature. In the absence of gravity the power output delivered to an inertial load is limited to approximately 1.4 times the maximum power of the muscle alone, and when gravity is present the power delivered is limited to approximately twice the power of muscle alone. These limits are found for the purely inertial load at Xi ca. 1 and with gravity acting at XiGamma = 0.5 with Xi arbitrarily small. The effects of nonlinear muscle and tendon properties tend to cancel each other out and do not produce large deviations from these optima. A lever system of constant ratio between muscle and load does not alter these limits. Cams and catches are required to exceed these limits and attain the high power outputs sometimes observed during explosive animal movement.},

abstract = {During walking on Earth, at 1.0 g of gravity, the work done by the muscles to maintain the motion of the centre of mass of the body (W(ext)) is reduced by a pendulum-like exchange between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy. The weight-specific W(ext) per unit distance attains a minimum of 0.3 J x kg(-1) x m(-1) at about 4.5 km x h(-1) in adults. The effect of a gravity change has been studied during walking on a force platform fixed to the floor of an aircraft undergoing flight profiles which resulted in a simulated gravity of 0.4 and 1.5 times that on Earth. At 0.4 g, such as on Mars, the minimum W(ext) was 0.15 J x kg(-1) x m(-1), half that on Earth and occurred at a slower speed, about 2.5 km x h(-1). The range of walking speeds is about half that on Earth. At 1.5 g, the lowest value of W(ext) was 0.60 J x kg(-1) x m(-1), twice that on Earth; it was nearly constant up to about 4.3 km x h(-1) and then increased with speed. The range of walking speeds is probably greater than that on Earth. A model is presented in which the speed for an optimum exchange between potential and kinetic energy, the 'optimal speed', is predicted by the balance between the forward deceleration due to the lift of the body against gravity and the forward deceleration due to the impact against the ground. In conclusion, over the range studied, gravity increases the work required to walk, but it also increases the range of walking speeds.},

abstract = {This viewpoint was stimulated by two observations: 1) the statistical skewness whereby numerous articles have reported tendon stiffness and Young's modulus, but far fewer have reported tendon hysteresis; 2) in vivo human studies seem very often to report hysteresis values greater than 10{\%}, suggesting either that there are methodological differences between human and animal studies, or that human tendons have a much poorer capacity to store and reutilize elastic energy. In this article we focus on the healthy human Achilles/gastrocnemius tendon (AT) since it has an important locomotor function and clearly a low AT hysteresis would allow elastic recoil for efficient locomotion. We discuss that both the measurement of tendon length and force and their correct synchronization can contribute to the variability of measures of tendon properties. Within the large variability the lower values are likely to be more valid, being consistent with animal studies.},

abstract = {Our aim was to compare an SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system with a strain gauge instrumented pedals system for right and left peak crank torque, crank angle of peak torque and power output. Seven competitive cyclists performed an incremental test to exhaustion on a stationary cycle ergometer equipped with an SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system and a strain gauge instrumented pedals system (SGI pedals). The SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system measured net torque while the SGI pedals measured the normal and anterior-posterior force applied on the pedal surface. Forces on the pedal surface were resolved into forces on the cranks (tangential and radial). Crank torque was measured by the pedals using the tangential force on the cranks and crank length. Power output was calculated from crank torque and angular velocity of the crank (calculated from pedalling cadence). All data were acquired between the 20thand the 40thseconds of each stage of the incremental test. Magnitudes of differences between outputs from the SGI pedals and the SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system were assessed by effect sizes. Power output was higher for the SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system than the SGI pedals. Peak torques were lower for the SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The angle of the right and left peak torque increased for the SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system overestimated power output, underestimated peak torque and increased the angle of peak torque compared to the SGI pedals. Where possible a strain gauge instrumented pedals system should be used to measure performance variables of cyclists rather than the SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {After some brief history, a mathematical model of a bicycle that has become a benchmark is described. The symbolic equations of motion of the bicycle are given in two forms and the equations are interpreted, with special reference to stability. The mechanics of autostabilization are discussed in detail. The relationship between design and behavior is shown to be heavily speed-dependent and complex. Using optimal linear preview control theory, rider control of the bicycle is studied. It is shown that steering control by an optimal rider, especially at low speeds, is powerful in comparison with a bicycle's selfsteering. This observation leads to the expectation that riders will be insensitive to variations in design, as has been observed in practice. Optimal preview speed control is also demonstrated. Extensions to the basic treatment of bicycle dynamics in the benchmark case are considered so that the modeling includes more realistic representations of tires, frames, and riders. The implications for stability predictions are discussed and it is shown that the moderate-speed behavior is altered little by the elaborations. Rider control theory is applied to the most realistic of the models considered and the results indicate a strong similarity between the benchmark case and the complex one, where they are directly comparable. In the complex case, steering control by rider-lean-torque is feasible and the results indicate that, when this is combined with steer-torque control, it is completely secondary. When only rider-lean-torque control is possible, extended preview is necessary, high-gain control is required, and the controls are relatively complex. Much that is known about the stability and control of bicycles is collected and explained, together with new material relating to modeling accuracy, bicycle design, and rider control.},

abstract = {Compliant tendons act as energy stores, which benefit the energetics and power output of a muscle-tendon unit. However the compliance of tendon and the material properties may vary between individuals and hence alter the energy storing capacity of the tendon. We aimed to determine the in vivo Achilles tendon (AT) stress and strain during one-legged hopping and hence the contribution of elastic recoil to mechanical energy changes. We simultaneously measured the length of the Achilles tendon from the muscle-tendon junction to the insertion on the calcaneous and the approximate AT force in ten male participants. The position of the muscle-tendon junction was determined using ultrasound images that were projected into three-dimensional space. Achilles tendon force was measured using inverse dynamics. The results demonstrated that one-legged hopping elicited high tendon strains and that the force-length relationship of the whole tendon is relatively linear, particularly at high strains. The stiffness, elastic modulus and hysteresis varied across the population (inter-quartile range of 145-231 N mm-1, 0.67-1.07 GPa and 17-35{\%}, respectively). These values are within the reported biological range. An average of 38 J of energy was recovered from the elastic recoil of the tendon, which contributes 16{\%} of the total average mechanical work of the hop (254 J). The high strains measured here (average peak strain was 8.3{\%}) and in other studies may be possible due to the complex architecture of the Achilles tendon; however, prolonged hopping may well cause tendon damage. In conclusion, the properties of the elastic Achilles tendon can contribute significantly to the total mechanical work of the body during one-legged hopping; however, individual variation in the properties of the tendon vary the energy storing capacity of this structure.},

abstract = {A variety of biomechanical data are sampled from smooth n-dimensional spatiotemporal fields. These data are usually analyzed discretely, by extracting summary metrics from particular points or regions in the continuum. It has been shown that, in certain situations, such schemes can compromise the spatiotemporal integrity of the original fields. An alternative methodology called statistical parametric mapping (SPM), designed specifically for continuous field analysis, constructs statistical images that lie in the original, biomechanically meaningful sampling space. The current paper demonstrates how SPM can be used to analyze both experimental and simulated biomechanical field data of arbitrary spatiotemporal dimensionality. Firstly, 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional spatiotemporal datasets derived from a pedobarographic experiment were analyzed using a common linear model to emphasize that SPM procedures are (practically) identical irrespective of the data's physical dimensionality. Secondly two probabilistic finite element simulation studies were conducted, examining heel pad stress and femoral strain fields, respectively, to demonstrate how SPM can be used to probe the significance of field-wide simulation results in the presence of uncontrollable or induced modeling uncertainty. Results were biomechanically intuitive and suggest that SPM may be suitable for a wide variety of mechanical field applications. SPM's main theoretical advantage is that it avoids problems associated with a priori assumptions regarding the spatiotemporal foci of field signals. SPM's main practical advantage is that a unified framework, encapsulated by a single linear equation, affords comprehensive statistical analyses of smooth scalar fields in arbitrarily bounded n-dimensional spaces. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Many classes of biomechanical data are smooth and contained within discrete bounds and as such are well suited to SPM analyses. The current paper accompanies release of 'SPM1D', a free and open-source Python package for conducting SPM analyses on a set of registered 1D curves. Three example applications are presented: (i) kinematics, (ii) ground reaction forces and (iii) contact pressure distribution in probabilistic finite element modelling. In addition to offering a high-level interface to a variety of common statistical tests like t tests, regression and ANOVA, SPM1D also emphasises fundamental concepts of SPM theory through stand-alone example scripts.

abstract = {A false positive is the mistake of inferring an effect when none exists, and although $\alpha$ controls the false positive (Type I error) rate in classical hypothesis testing, a given $\alpha$ value is accurate only if the underlying model of randomness appropriately reflects experimentally observed variance. Hypotheses pertaining to one-dimensional (1D) (e.g. time-varying) biomechanical trajectories are most often tested using a traditional zero-dimensional (0D) Gaussian model of randomness, but variance in these datasets is clearly 1D. The purpose of this study was to determine the likelihood that analyzing smooth 1D data with a 0D model of variance will produce false positives. We first used random field theory (RFT) to predict the probability of false positives in 0D analyses. We then validated RFT predictions via numerical simulations of smooth Gaussian 1D trajectories. Results showed that, across a range of public kinematic, force/moment and EMG datasets, the median false positive rate was 0.382 and not the assumed $\alpha$=0.05, even for a simple two-sample t test involving N=10 trajectories per group. The median false positive rate for experiments involving three-component vector trajectories was p=0.764. This rate increased to p=0.945 for two three-component vector trajectories, and to p=0.999 for six three-component vectors. This implies that experiments involving vector trajectories have a high probability of yielding 0D statistical significance when there is, in fact, no 1D effect. Either (a) explicit a priori identification of 0D variables or (b) adoption of 1D methods can more tightly control $\alpha$.},

abstract = {Metabolic rates can increase 21 times above resting levels during cycling with the majority attributed to muscular contractions. Metabolic estimates attained through gas exchange parameters are limited by the respiration rate and time delay with respect to these contractions. In contrast surface electromyography (EMG) contains instantaneous muscle contraction information at higher temporal resolutions. An adequate metabolic power-EMG relationship has not been established to use EMG as a metabolic estimate during dynamic activities. The purpose of this study was to establish a metabolic power-EMG relationship during non steady-state conditions. Participants cycled at workloads between 25 and 90{\%} O2max while EMG and gas exchange were monitored. The EMG was resolved into intensities and total EMG intensity was calculated as the sum of intensities across all muscles for each pedal cycle. Metabolic power was estimated from gas exchange parameters and the mean total EMG intensity between breaths was calculated and used as breath-by-breath values. Comparisons were made between breath-by-breath resolutions of metabolic power and total EMG intensity. Different weighting coefficients were also applied to the EMG for each muscle to analyze the effects of different muscle weightings on metabolic power estimations. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.91) between estimates of metabolic power from EMG and gas exchange. Muscle weighting had a significant effect on metabolic power determination with the highest and lowest correlated estimates having the largest weightings on muscles proximal and distal to the knee respectively. This study demonstrates that EMG contains important information about the metabolic costs of muscle contractions and provides good predictions of metabolic changes during non steady-state conditions. Also, the importance of each muscle is workload dependent with inappropriate weightings reducing metabolic estimations. These findings have implications for future EMG applications as they provide more immediate, higher temporal resolution predictions of changes in metabolic power.},

During active contractions this process allows muscles to operate at mechanically favorable conditions for power or economical force production. Here we ask whether gearing is constant in passive muscle; determining the relationship between fascicle and muscle-tendon unit length change in the bi-articular medial gastrocnemius and investigating the influence of whether motion occurs at the knee or ankle joint. Specifically, the same muscle-tendon unit length changes were elicited by rotating either the ankle or knee joint whilst simultaneously measuring fascicle lengths in proximal and distal muscle regions using B-mode ultrasound. In both the proximal and distal muscle region, passive gearing values differed depending on whether ankle or knee motion occurred. Fascicle length changes were greater with ankle motion, likely reflecting anatomical differences in proximal and distal passive tendinous tissues, as well as shape changes of the adjacent mono-articular soleus. This suggests that there is joint-dependent dissociation between the mechanical behavior of muscle fibers and the muscle-tendon unit during passive joint motions that may be important to consider when developing accurate models of bi-articular muscles.},

abstract = {The anatomical complexity of myomeres and myosepta has made it difficult to develop a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between muscle fiber architecture, connective tissue mechanics, and locomotor function of segmented axial musculature in fishes. The lateral hypaxial musculature (LHM) of salamanders is less anatomically complex and therefore a good system for exploring the basic mechanics of segmented musculature. Here, we derive a mathematical model of the LHM and test our model using sonomicrometry and electromyography during steady swimming in an aquatic salamander, Siren lacertina. The model predicts longitudinal segment strain well, with predicted and measured values differing by less than 5{\%} strain over most of the range. Deviations between predicted and measured results are unbiased and probably result from the salamanders performing slight turns with associated body torsion in our unconstrained trackway swimming experiments. Model simulations of muscle fiber contraction and segment shortening indicate that longitudinal segment strain, for a given amount of muscle fiber strain, increases with increasing initial fiber angle. This increase in architectural gear ratio (AGR = longitudinal strain/fiber strain) is mediated by muscle fiber rotation; the higher the initial fiber angle, the more the fibers rotate during contraction and the higher the AGR. Muscle fiber rotation is additionally impacted by bulging in the dorsoventral (DV) and/or mediolateral (ML) dimensions during longitudinal segment shortening. In segments with obliquely oriented muscle fibers, DV bulging increases muscle fiber rotation, thereby increasing the AGR. Extending the model to include force and work indicates that force decreases with increasing initial muscle fiber angle and increasing DV bulging and that both longitudinal shortening and DV bulging must be included for accurate calculation of segment work.},

abstract = {Many locomotor activities require muscles to actively lengthen, dissipate energy and decelerate the body. These eccentric contractions can disrupt cytoskeletal structures within myofibrils and reduce force output. We examined how architectural features of pennate muscles can provide a protective mechanism against eccentric muscle damage by limiting fascicle lengthening. It has been previously shown that the angled fibers of pennate muscles change orientation when shortening. This change in fiber orientation can amplify fascicle shortening, resulting in a velocity advantage at the level of the muscle-tendon unit (MTU) that is characterized by a gear ratio (MTU velocity/fascicle velocity). A muscle's architectural gear ratio (AGR) has been shown to vary as a function of force during shortening, while AGR during lengthening remains largely unknown. We independently measured fascicle length and MTU length in vitro in the bullfrog plantaris. We characterized the muscle's force-velocity curve and AGR during both shortening and lengthening across a broad range of forces (10-190{\%} peak isometric force). AGR was measured during the isotonic portion of each contraction, to eliminate possible contributions of series elasticity to MTU length changes. We found that gear ratio varies with force during both shortening and lengthening contractions. The highest AGR was observed during lengthening contractions, indicating that lengthening of the MTU can occur with relatively little stretch of the fascicle. As fascicle strain is considered an important determinant of muscle damage, a high gear ratio may afford pennate muscles protection against the damaging effects of active lengthening.},

abstract = {Ultrasonography is a useful technique to study muscle contractions in vivo, however larger muscles like vastus lateralis may be difficult to visualise with smaller, commonly used transducers. Fascicle length is often estimated using linear trigonometry to extrapolate fascicle length to regions where the fascicle is not visible. However, this approach has not been compared to measurements made with a larger field of view for dynamic muscle contractions. Here we compared two different single-transducer extrapolation methods to measure VL muscle fascicle length to a direct measurement made using two synchronised, in-series transducers. The first method used pennation angle and muscle thickness to extrapolate fascicle length outside the image (extrapolate method). The second method determined fascicle length based on the extrapolated intercept between a fascicle and the aponeurosis (intercept method). Nine participants performed maximal effort, isometric, knee extension contractions on a dynamometer at 10° increments from 50 to 100° of knee flexion. Fascicle length and torque were simultaneously recorded for offline analysis. The dual transducer method showed similar patterns of fascicle length change (overall mean coefficient of multiple correlation was 0.76 and 0.71 compared to extrapolate and intercept methods respectively), but reached different absolute lengths during the contractions. This had the effect of producing force–length curves of the same shape, but each curve was shifted in terms of absolute length. We concluded that dual transducers are beneficial for studies that examine absolute fascicle lengths, whereas either of the single transducer methods may produce similar results for normalised length changes, and repeated measures experimental designs.},

abstract = {The surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal that originates in the muscle is inevitably contaminated by various noise signals or artifacts that originate at the skin-electrode interface, in the electronics that amplifies the signals, and in external sources. Modern technology is substantially immune to some of these noises, but not to the baseline noise and the movement artifact noise. These noise sources have frequency spectra that contaminate the low-frequency part of the sEMG frequency spectrum. There are many factors which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate filter specifications to remove these artifacts; they include the muscle tested and type of contraction, the sensor configuration, and specific noise source. The band-pass determination is always a compromise between (a) reducing noise and artifact contamination, and (b) preserving the desired information from the sEMG signal. This study was designed to investigate the effects of mechanical perturbations and noise that are typically encountered during sEMG recordings in clinical and related applications. The analysis established the relationship between the attenuation rates of the movement artifact and the sEMG signal as a function of the filter band pass. When this relationship is combined with other considerations related to the informational content of the signal, the signal distortion of filters, and the kinds of artifacts evaluated in this study, a Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20. Hz and a slope of 12. dB/oct is recommended for general use. The results of this study are relevant to biomechanical and clinical applications where the measurements of body dynamics and kinematics may include artifact sources. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Architectural values are used to model muscle-joint behavior and to make surgical decisions. The two most extensively used human lower extremity data sets consist of five total specimens of unknown size, gender, and age. Therefore, it is critically important to generate a high-fidelity human lower extremity muscle architecture data set. We disassembled 27 muscles from 21 human lower extremities to characterize muscle fiber length and physiologic cross-sectional area, which define the excursion and force-generating capacities of a muscle. Based on their architectural features, the soleus, gluteus medius, and vastus lateralis are the strongest muscles, whereas the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus have the largest excursion. The plantarflexors, knee extensors, and hip adductors are the strongest muscle groups acting at each joint, whereas the hip adductors and hip extensors have the largest excursion. Contrary to previous assertions, two-joint muscles do not necessarily have longer fibers than single-joint muscles as seen by the similarity of knee flexor and extensor fiber lengths. These high-resolution data will facilitate the development of more accurate musculoskeletal models and challenge existing theories of muscle design; we believe they will aid in surgical decision making.},

Cycling is considered as a low impact exercise for the hip joint and hence recommended. However, there are limited data about hip joint loading to support this claim. The aim of this study was to measure synchronously the in vivo hip joint loads and pedal forces during cycling. The in vivo hip joint loads were measured in 5 patients with instrumented hip implants. Data were collected at several combinations of power and cadence, at two saddle heights. Joint loads and pedal forces showed strong linear correlation with power. So the relationship between the external pedal forces and internal joint forces was shown. While cycling at different cadences the minimum joint loads were acquired at 60 RPM. The lower saddle height configuration results in an approximately 15{\%} increase compared to normal saddle height. The results offered new insights into the actual effects of cycling on the hip joint and can serve as useful tools while developing an optimum cycling regimen for individuals with coxarthrosis or following total hip arthroplasty. Due to the relatively low contact forces, cycling at a moderate power level of 90 W at a normal saddle height is suitable for patients.},

abstract = {Muscle fiber architecture, i.e., the physical arrangement of fibers within a muscle, is an important determinant of a muscle's mechanical function. In pennate muscles, fibers are oriented at an angle to the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). The magnitude of fiber rotation, and therefore gear ratio, depends on how the muscle changes shape in the dimensions orthogonal to the muscle's line of action. Here, we show that gear ratio is not fixed for a given muscle but decreases significantly with the force of contraction (P {\textless} 0.0001). We find that dynamic muscle-shape changes promote fiber rotation at low forces and resist fiber rotation at high forces. As a result, gearing varies automatically with the load, to favor velocity output during low-load contractions and force output for contractions against high loads. Therefore, muscle-shape changes act as an automatic transmission system allowing a pennate muscle to shift from a high gear during rapid contractions to low gear during forceful contractions. These results suggest that variable gearing in pennate muscles provides a mechanism to modulate muscle performance during mechanically diverse functions.},

METHODS Seventeen recreationally active cyclists performed 6 stages of constant load cycling using cadences of 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 rpm. Joint specific power was calculated using inverse dynamics and mVO2 and oxygenation were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS Increasing cadence led to increased knee joint power and decreased hip joint power while the ankle joint was unaffected. Increasing cadence also led to an increased deoxygenation in both the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. Vastus lateralis mVO2 increased when cadence was increased. No effect of cadence was found for vastus medialis mVO2. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates a different effect of cadence on the mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. The combined mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and medialis showed a linear increase with increasing knee joint specific power, demonstrating that the muscles combined related to power generated over the joint.},

abstract = {The relative contributions of muscle force, moment arm, and tendon compliance were determined as a function of joint angle in the frog semitendinosus-hip joint system. Muscle, joint, and tendon properties were individually measured and then combined to predict the torque generated at the hip joint as a function of joint angle (i.e., the hip torque profile). Predicted torques were then compared to experimentally measured torques using a stepwise regression model to quantify the relative importance of muscle, joint, and tendon contributions to the hip torque profile. Variation in moment arm accounted for 74{\%} of the variability observed in the hip torque profile, while addition of the muscle's intrinsic sarcomere length-tension property accounted for an additional 19{\%} of the torque profile variability. Tendon compliance, which permitted a small amount of sarcomere shortening, accounted for only about 4{\%} of the torque profile variability. We conclude that in this muscle-joint system, the relative fiber length-to-moment arm ratio is the major determinant of the shape of the isometric joint profile. The fiber length-to-moment arm ratio in other mammalian systems is also discussed.},

abstract = {OpenSim provides to its biomechanics users a calculation called “muscle moment arm” which captures to some degree the leverage of a particular muscle with respect to a particular joint, while in a given configuration. For simple cases, this is the same as the conventional moment arm calculation in mechanical engineering. A straight-line muscle whose origin and insertion points connect two adjacent bodies connected by a pin joint is the simplest case. In practice, however, a muscle may span several joints (wrist, neck, spine) and will follow a contorted crossing over various curved bone surfaces. For these situations we need a careful definition of “muscle moment arm” that is analogous to the mechanical engineering concept and of use to biomedical researchers. There are other related quantities that can easily be confused with moment arm, such as the amount of joint acceleration that a muscle can produce. That will be equivalent to moment arm in simple cases but confusingly different in more complex situations. Here we will give a precise definition of what we mean by “muscle moment arm” and, given that definition, how that quantity may be efficiently calculated. We will not attempt to address any deeper questions such as when you should be interested in moment arm or how you should use it.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of cadence on joint specific power and cycling kinematics in the ankle joint in addition to muscle oxygenation and muscle VO2 in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Thirteen cyclists cycled at a cadence of 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 rpm at a constant external work rate of 160.1 ± 21.3 W. Increasing cadence led to a decrease in ankle power in the dorsal flexion phase and to an increase in ankle joint angular velocity above 80 rpm. In addition, increasing cadence increased deoxygenation and desaturation for both the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Muscle VO2 increased following increased cadence but only in the tibialis anterior and only at cadences above 80 rpm, thus coinciding with the increase in ankle joint angular velocity. There was no effect of cadence in the gastrocnemius. This study demonstrates that high cadences lead to increased mVO2 in the TA muscles that cannot be explained by power in the dorsal flexion phase.},

abstract = {Optimising body position on the bicycle may improve performance and reduce overuse injury risk. However, effectiveness of bicycle configuration in preventing overuse injuries is unknown as methods to assess body position on the bicycle (usually via static assessment) lack accuracy and are limited to road cyclists. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) assess validity and reliability of methods for determining body position (kinematics) and pedalling kinetics in cycling; and 2) to analyse effects from changes in saddle height and horizontal position on pedalling kinetics and kinematics of cyclists and triathletes. Pedal force effectiveness, crank torque, joint angles and joint mechanical work during cycling on an ergometer were measured for recreational and competitive road cyclists and competitive triathletes, with and without lower limb pain, in five experimental studies. Analysis of static 6 o'clock crank position was not valid therefore body position on the bicycle should be measured using video from cycling motion. Instrumented pedals should be used for pedalling kinetics assessment as bilateral asymmetry was underestimated using the SRM{\textregistered} torque analysis system. Reliability of pedal forces from instrumented pedals computed seven days apart was high. Technique training using feedback from instrumented pedal forces at training workloads and high pedalling cadence improved power output. Using improved knee joint modelling, cyclists with and without pain had similar adaptations to changes in saddle height. Saddle height changes of 5{\%} of the self-selected preferred saddle height did not result in substantial changes in pedalling kinetics. Moving forward or backward on the saddle affected joint mechanical work but not knee joint forces. Saddle position changed pedalling technique similarly in cyclists and triathletes. To optimise cyclists and triathletes body position on the bicycle and their technique, instrumented pedals should be used to assess pedalling kinetics and video analysis should be used to assess kinematics.},

abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is increasingly used with motion and force data to quantify tendon dynamics during human movement. Frequently, tendon dynamics are estimated indirectly from muscle fascicle kinematics (by subtracting muscle from muscle-tendon unit length), but there is mounting evidence that this Indirect approach yields implausible tendon work loops. Since tendons are passive viscoelastic structures, when they undergo a loading-unloading cycle they must exhibit a negative work loop (i.e., perform net negative work). However, prior studies using this Indirect approach report large positive work loops, often estimating that tendons return 2–5 J of elastic energy for every 1 J of energy stored. More direct ultrasound estimates of tendon kinematics have emerged that quantify tendon elongations by tracking either the muscle-tendon junction or localized tendon tissue. However, it is unclear if these yield more plausible estimates of tendon dynamics. Our objective was to compute tendon work loops and hysteresis losses using these two Direct tendon kinematics estimates during human walking. We found that Direct estimates generally resulted in negative work loops, with average tendon hysteresis losses of 2–11{\%} at 1.25 m/s and 33–49{\%} at 0.75 m/s (N = 8), alluding to 0.51–0.98 J of tendon energy returned for every 1 J stored. We interpret this finding to suggest that Direct approaches provide more plausible estimates than the Indirect approach, and may be preferable for understanding tendon energy storage and return. However, the Direct approaches did exhibit speed-dependent trends that are not consistent with isolated, in vitro tendon hysteresis losses of about 5–10{\%}. These trends suggest that Direct estimates also contain some level of error, albeit much smaller than Indirect estimates. Overall, this study serves to highlight the complexity and difficulty of estimating tendon dynamics non-invasively, and the care that must be taken to interpret biological function from current ultrasound-based estimates.},

abstract = {—Existing ''off-the-shelf'' musculoskeletal models are problematic when simulating movements that involve substantial hip and knee flexion, such as the upstroke of pedalling, because they tend to generate excessive passive fibre force. The goal of this study was to develop a refined musculoskeletal model capable of simulating pedalling and fast running, in addition to walking, which predicts the activation patterns of muscles better than existing models. Specifically, we tested whether the anomalous co-activation of antagonist muscles, commonly observed in simulations, could be resolved if the passive forces generated by the underlying model were diminished. We refined the Open-Sim TM model published by Rajagopal et al. (IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 63:1–1, 2016) by increasing the model's range of knee flexion, updating the paths of the knee muscles, and modifying the force-generating properties of eleven muscles. Simulations of pedalling, running and walking based on this model reproduced measured EMG activity better than simulations based on the existing model—even when both models tracked the same subject-specific kinematics. Improvements in the predicted activations were associated with decreases in the net passive moments; for example, the net passive knee moment during the upstroke of pedalling decreased from 36.9 N m (existing model) to 6.3 N m (refined model), resulting in a dramatic decrease in the co-activation of knee flexors. The refined model is available from SimTK.org and is suitable for analysing movements with up to 120° of hip flexion and 140° of knee flexion.},

abstract = {To descend a flight of stairs, would you rather walk or fall? Falling seems to have some obvious disadvantages such as the risk of pain or injury. But the preferred strategy of walking also entails a cost for the use of active muscles to perform negative work. The amount and distribution of work a person chooses to perform may, therefore, reflect a subjective valuation of the trade-offs between active muscle effort and other costs, such as pain. Here we use a simple jump landing experiment to quantify the work humans prefer to perform to dissipate the energy of landing. We found that healthy normal subjects (N = 8) preferred a strategy that involved performing 37{\%} more negative work than minimally necessary (P{\textless}0.001) across a range of landing heights. This then required additional positive work to return to standing rest posture, highlighting the cost of this preference. Subjects were also able to modulate the amount of landing work, and its distribution between active and passive tissues. When instructed to land softly, they performed 76{\%} more work than necessary (P{\textless}0.001), with a higher proportion from active muscles (89{\%} vs. 84{\%}, P{\textless}0.001). Stiff-legged landings, performed by one subject for demonstration, exhibited close to the minimum of work, with more of it performed passively through soft tissue deformations (at least 30{\%} in stiff landings vs. 16{\%} preferred). During jump landings, humans appear not to minimize muscle work, but instead choose to perform a consistent amount of extra work, presumably to avoid other subjective costs. The degree to which work is not minimized may indirectly quantify the relative valuation of costs that are otherwise difficult to measure.},

The weak evidence provided by P values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive rates. When you observe P = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value.

abstract = {We measured how much metabolic energy is expended to swing a human leg. A previous dynamical model of walking predicted that increasing metabolic costs for walking with step length and step frequency trade-off against each other to determine the optimum step combination at a given speed. Simple pendulum dynamics indicate that the cost of walking at high step frequencies could be associated with driving the legs back and forth relative to the body, at a rate increasing approximately with the fourth power of frequency, possibly due to the low economy of producing muscle force for short durations. A similar cost would be expected for isolated swinging of a leg at faster than its natural frequency. We constructed an apparatus to measure work performed on the leg, and measured metabolic cost as human subjects (N=12) swung one leg at frequencies 0.5-1.1 Hz and fixed amplitude. Rate of mechanical work ranged from 0.02-0.27 W kg(-1) over these frequencies. Net metabolic rate for leg swinging (subtracting that for quiet standing) increased from 0.41-2.10 W kg(-1), approximately with the fourth power of frequency (R(2)=0.92) and in proportion to a hypothesized cost of force production for short durations. The costs of producing force and work could account for the increase. In a crude comparison, moving the legs back and forth at a typical stride frequency of 0.9 Hz, might consume about one-third of the net energy (2.8+/-0.8 W kg(-1)) needed for walking at 1.3 m s(-1).},

abstract = {The passive dynamics of bipedal limbs alone are sufficient to produce a walking motion, without need for control. Humans augment these dynamics with muscles, actively coordinated to produce stable and economical walking. Present robots using passive dynamics walk much slower, perhaps because they lack elastic muscles that couple the joints. Elastic properties are well known to enhance running gaits, but their effect on walking has yet to be explored. Here we use a computational model of dynamic walking to show that elastic joint coupling can help to coordinate faster walking. In walking powered by trailing leg push-off, the model's speed is normally limited by a swing leg that moves too slowly to avoid stumbling. A uni-articular spring about the knee allows faster but uneconomical walking. A combination of uni-articular hip and knee springs can speed the legs for improved speed and economy, but not without the swing foot scuffing the ground. Bi-articular springs coupling the hips and knees can yield high economy and good ground clearance similar to humans. An important parameter is the knee-to-hip moment arm that greatly affects the existence and stability of gaits, and when selected appropriately can allow for a wide range of speeds. Elastic joint coupling may contribute to the economy and stability of human gait.},

abstract = {Muscle–tendon units about the ankle joint generate a burst of positive power during the step-to-step transition in human walking, termed ankle push-off, but there is no scientific consensus on its functional role. A central question embodied in the biomechanics literature is: does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing, or to center of mass (COM) acceleration? This question has been debated in various forms for decades. However, it actually presents a false dichotomy, as these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. If we ask either question independently, the answer is the same: yes! (1) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing acceleration? Yes. (2) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to COM acceleration? Yes. Here, we summarize the historical debate, then synthesize the seemingly polarized perspectives and demonstrate that both descriptions are valid. The principal means by which ankle push-off affects COM mechanics is by a localized action that increases the speed and kinetic energy of the trailing push-off limb. Because the limb is included in body COM computations, this localized segmental acceleration also accelerates the COM, and most of the segmental energy change also appears as COM energy change. Interpretation of ankle mechanics should abandon an either/or contrast of leg swing versus COM acceleration. Instead, ankle push-off should be interpreted in light of both mutually consistent effects. This unified perspective informs our fundamental understanding of the role of ankle push-off, and has important implications for the design of clinical interventions (e.g. prostheses, orthoses) intended to restore locomotor function to individuals with disabilities.},

abstract = {In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths (0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length (from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that cycling in a standing position reduces cycling economy compared with seated cycling. It is unknown whether the cycling intensity moderates the reduction in cycling economy while standing. PURPOSE: The aim was to determine whether the negative effect of standing on cycling economy would be decreased at a higher intensity. METHODS: Ten cyclists cycled in 8 different conditions. Each condition was either at an intensity of 50{\%} or 70{\%} of maximal aerobic power, at a gradient of 4{\%} or 8{\%} and in the seated or standing cycling position. Cycling economy and muscle activation level of 8 leg muscles were recorded. RESULTS: There was an interaction between cycling intensity and position for cycling economy (P = 0.03), the overall activation of the leg muscles (P = 0.02) and the activation of the lower leg muscles (P = 0.05). The interaction showed decreased cycling economy when standing compared with seated cycling, but the difference was reduced at higher intensity. The overall activation of the leg muscles and the lower leg muscles respectively increased and decreased, but the differences between standing and seated cycling were reduced at higher intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Cycling economy was lower during standing cycling than seated cycling, but the difference in economy diminishes when cycling intensity increases. Activation of the lower leg muscles did not explain the lower cycling economy while standing. The increased overall activation therefore suggests that increased activation of the upper leg muscles explains part of the lower cycling economy while standing.},

We measured kinematics and pedal forces and used inverse dynamics to calculate joint power for the hip, knee and ankle joints during an incremental cycling protocol performed by 21 recreational cyclists. Vastus lateralis mVO2 was estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy with an arterial occlusion. The main finding was a non-linear relationship between vastus lateralis mVO2 and external work rate that was characterised by an increase followed by a tendency for a levelling off (R2=0.99 and 0.94 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p{\textless}0.05). When comparing 100 W and 225 W, there was a {\~{}}43 W increase in knee extension but still a {\~{}}9{\%} decrease in relative contribution of knee extension to external work rate resulting from a {\~{}}47 W increase in hip extension. When vastus lateralis mVO2 was related to knee extension power, the relationship was still non-linear (R2=0.99 and 0.97 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p{\textless}0.05). These results demonstrate a non-linear response in mVO2 relative to a change in external work rate. Relating vastus lateralis mVO2 to knee extension power showed a better fit to a linear equation compared to external work rate, but it is not a straight line.},

abstract = {Animals must continually respond dynamically as they move through complex environments, and slopes are a common terrain on which legged animals must move. Despite this, non-level locomotion remains poorly understood. In this study, we first review the literature on locomotor mechanics, metabolic cost, and kinematic strategies on slopes. Using existing literature we then performed scaling analyses of kinematic variables, including speed, duty factor, and stride-length across a range of body sizes from ants to horses. The studies that examined locomotion on inclines vastly outnumbered those focusing on declines. On inclines, animals tend to reduce speed and increase duty factor, but a similar consensus could not be reached for declines. Remarkably, stride-length did not differ between locomotion on inclines and on level terrain, but this may have resulted from data only being available for low slopes ({\textless}30°). On declines there appears to be a shift in locomotor strategy that is size-dependent. At masses {\textless}1-10 kg, animals tended to use shorter strides than on level terrain, and the opposite occurred at larger body masses. Therefore, possibly due to stability issues, body mass plays a significant role in the locomotor strategy used when traveling downhill. Although we currently lack sufficient data, differential leg function is likely to be critical for locomotion on slopes, with mechanical demands differing on limbs during movement on level, inclined, and declined surfaces. Our scaling analysis not only highlights areas that require future work, but also suggests that body size is important for determining the mechanics and strategies animals use to negotiate non-level terrain. It is clear that selection has resulted in an incredible range of body size among animals, both extant and extinct, and it is likely that the ability to move up and down slopes has constrained or relaxed these mechanical pressures. Given the lack of integration of ecological data with laboratory experiments, future work should first determine which inclines animals actually use in nature, as this likely plays a key role in behaviors such as predator-prey interactions.},

abstract = {Larger terrestrial animals tend to support their weight with more upright limbs. This makes structural sense, reducing the loading on muscles and bones, which is disproportionately challenging in larger animals. However, it does not account for why smaller animals are more crouched; instead, they could enjoy relatively more slender supporting structures or higher safety factors. Here, an alternative account for the scaling of posture is proposed, with close parallels to the scaling of jump performance. If the costs of locomotion are related to the volume of active muscle, and the active muscle volume required depends on both the work and the power demanded during the push-off phase of each step (not just the net positive work), then the disproportional scaling of requirements for work and push-off power are revealing. Larger animals require relatively greater active muscle volumes for dynamically similar gaits (e.g. top walking speed)-which may present an ultimate constraint to the size of running animals. Further, just as for jumping, animals with shorter legs and briefer push-off periods are challenged to provide the power (not the work) required for push-off. This can be ameliorated by having relatively long push-off periods, potentially accounting for the crouched stance of small animals.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the precise effect of plyometric training (PT) on vertical jump height in healthy individuals. Meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effect of PT on four typical vertical jump height tests were carried out: squat jump (SJ); countermovement jump (CMJ); countermovement jump with the arm swing (CMJA); and drop jump (DJ). Studies were identified by computerised and manual searches of the literature. Data on changes in jump height for the plyometric and control groups were extracted and statistically pooled in a meta-analysis, separately for each type of jump. A total of 26 studies yielding 13 data points for SJ, 19 data points for CMJ, 14 data points for CMJA and 7 data points for DJ met the initial inclusion criteria. The pooled estimate of the effect of PT on vertical jump height was 4.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.8 to 7.6{\%}), 8.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 7.0 to 10.4{\%}), 7.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 4.2 to 10.8{\%}) and 4.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.8 to 8.6{\%}) for the SJ, CMJ, CMJA and DJ, respectively. When expressed in standardised units (ie, effect sizes), the effect of PT on vertical jump height was 0.44 (95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.72), 0.88 (95{\%} CI 0.64 to 1.11), 0.74 (95{\%} CI 0.47 to 1.02) and 0.62 (95{\%} CI 0.18 to 1.05) for the SJ, CMJ, CMJA and DJ, respectively. PT provides a statistically significant and practically relevant improvement in vertical jump height with the mean effect ranging from 4.7{\%} (SJ and DJ), over 7.5{\%} (CMJA) to 8.7{\%} (CMJ). These results justify the application of PT for the purpose of development of vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.},

abstract = {In walking, humans prefer a moderate step width that minimizes energetic cost and vary step width from step-to-step to maintain lateral balance. Arm swing also reduces energetic cost and improves lateral balance. In running, humans prefer a narrow step width that may present a challenge for maintaining lateral balance. However, arm swing in running may improve lateral balance and help reduce energetic cost. To understand the roles of step width and arm swing, we hypothesized that net metabolic power would be greater at step widths greater or less than preferred and when running without arm swing. We further hypothesized that step width variability (indicator of lateral balance) would be greater at step widths greater or less than preferred and when running without arm swing. Ten subjects ran (3. m/s) at four target step widths (0{\%}, 15{\%}, 20{\%}, and 25{\%} leg length (LL)) with arm swing, at their preferred step width with arm swing, and at their preferred step width without arm swing. We measured metabolic power, step width, and step width variability. When subjects ran at target step widths less (0{\%} LL) or greater (15{\%}, 20{\%}, and 25{\%} LL) than preferred, both net metabolic power demand (by 3{\%}, 9{\%}, 12{\%}, and 15{\%}) and step width variability (by 7{\%}, 33{\%}, 46{\%}, and 69{\%}) increased. When running without arm swing, both net metabolic power demand (by 8{\%}) and step width variability (by 9{\%}) increased compared to running with arm swing. It appears that humans prefer to run with a narrow step width and swing their arms so as to minimize energetic cost and improve lateral balance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Muscles actuate running by developing forces that propel the body forward while supporting the body's weight. To understand how muscles contribute to propulsion (i.e., forward acceleration of the mass center) and support (i.e., upward acceleration of the mass center) during running we developed a three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulation of the running gait cycle. The simulation is driven by 92 musculotendon actuators of the lower extremities and torso and includes the dynamics of arm motion. We analyzed the simulation to determine how each muscle contributed to the acceleration of the body mass center. During the early part of the stance phase, the quadriceps muscle group was the largest contributor to braking (i.e., backward acceleration of the mass center) and support. During the second half of the stance phase, the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were the greatest contributors to propulsion and support. The arms did not contribute substantially to either propulsion or support, generating less than 1{\%} of the peak mass center acceleration. However, the arms effectively counterbalanced the vertical angular momentum of the lower extremities. Our analysis reveals that the quadriceps and plantarflexors are the major contributors to acceleration of the body mass center during running. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Efforts to understand human physiology through the study of champion athletes and record performances have been ongoing for about a century. For endurance sports three main factors--maximal oxygen consumption (.VO(2,max)), the so-called 'lactate threshold' and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to generate a given running speed or cycling power output)--appear to play key roles in endurance performance. and lactate threshold interact to determine the 'performance .VO(2)' which is the oxygen consumption that can be sustained for a given period of time. Efficiency interacts with the performance .VO(2) to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently known about how these factors interact, their utility as predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this context, definitive ideas about the physiological determinants of running and cycling efficiency is relatively lacking in comparison with .VO(2,max) and the lactate threshold, and there is surprisingly limited and clear information about the genetic factors that might pre-dispose for elite performance. It should also be cautioned that complex motivational and sociological factors also play important roles in who does or does not become a champion and these factors go far beyond simple physiological explanations. Therefore, the performance of elite athletes is likely to defy the types of easy explanations sought by scientific reductionism and remain an important puzzle for those interested in physiological integration well into the future.},

abstract = {The equine biceps brachii (biceps) initiates rapid limb protraction through a catapult mechanism. Elastic strain energy is slowly stored in an internal tendon and is then rapidly released to protract the forelimb. The muscle fibres are short, have little scope for length change and can therefore only shorten slowly compared with the speed at which the whole muscle must shorten, which makes them poor candidates for driving rapid limb protraction. We suggest that the muscle fibres in the biceps act to modulate the elastic energy output of the muscle-tendon unit (MTU) to meet the demands of locomotion under different conditions. We hypothesise that more elastic strain energy is stored and released from the biceps MTU during higher speed locomotion to accommodate the increase in energy required to protract the limb and that this can be achieved by varying the length change and activation conditions of the muscle. We examined the work performed by the biceps during trot and canter using an inverse dynamics analysis (IDA). We then used excised biceps muscles to determine how much work could be performed by the muscle in active and passive stretch-shorten cycles. A muscle model was developed to investigate the influence of changes in activation parameters on energy storage and energy return from the biceps MTU. Increased biceps MTU length change and increased work performed by the biceps MTU were found at canter compared with at trot. More work was performed by the ex vivo biceps MTU following activation of the muscle and by increasing muscle length change. However, the ratio of active to passive work diminished with increasing length change. The muscle model demonstrated that duration and timing of activation during stretch-shorten cycles could modulate the elastic energy storage and return from the biceps. We conclude that the equine biceps MTU acts as a tuneable spring and the contractile component functions to modulate the energy required for rapid forelimb protraction at different speeds.},

METHODS: Eleven healthy men performed submaximal pedaling exercises on an electrically braked ergometer at different workloads and with or without pedal straps. During these tasks, surface electromyograms (SEMGs) were recorded from the RF using 36 electrode pairs, and central locus activation (CLA) was calculated along the longitudinal line of the muscle. RESULTS: CLA moved markedly, indicating changes in spatial distribution of SEMG within the muscle, during a crank cycle under all conditions (P {\textless} 0.05). There were significant differences in CLA among different workloads and between those with and without pedal straps (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that neuromuscular activation within the RF is regulated regionally by changes in workload and the use of pedal straps during pedaling.},

Performance enhancement is more consistent in highly-trained participants following multiple sets of a biomechanically similar conditioning activity. Providing optimal conditions, 6 international-level sprint cyclists executed multiple sets of short maximal conditioning contractions on a high-inertia ergometer before metered sprint performance. Three trial conditions were completed on separate days after a standardised warm-up: dynamic (DYN: 4 × 4 crank-cycles), isometric (ISO: 4 × 5-sec maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)), and control (CON: rest). Performance was measured from standing start to maximum velocity on an inertial-load ergometer at baseline (Pre), 4 (Post4), 8 (Post8) and 16 (Post16) min post-conditioning. Performance and biomechanical measures were assessed across 4 sprint segments, with magnitude-based inferences used to assess the likelihood that any affect was beneficial. Performance time only improved in DYN Post4, a 3.9{\%} reduction during the first crank cycle (92{\%} likely). On the ascending limb of the power-cadence relationship, peak torque and average power increased by 6.2{\%} (94{\%} likely) and 4.0{\%} (87{\%} likely), respectively. In ISOPost16, optimal cadence increased (82{\%} likely) and average power improved over the descending limb (76{\%} likely). DYN and ISO potentiated extremities of the torque-cadence relationship at distinct recovery times post-conditioning. This study suggests merit in including a high-inertia warm-up for sprint cycling.},

Investigation of how muscles function during locomotion and the relative length change in muscle fibres and the associated elastic tendon has, however, been more challenging. In recent years, novel in vivo measurement methods such as ultrasound and sonomicrometry have contributed to our understanding of the dynamics of the muscle tendon unit during locomotion. Here, we examine both published and new data to explore how muscles are arranged to deliver the wide repertoire of locomotor function and the trade-offs between performance and economy that result.},

abstract = {The activation of a muscle depends on the function that it is performing and on the architectural properties of that muscle; the two are inextricably linked. Activation conditions such as activation timing, duration and amplitude can be varied throughout a cyclical movement (such as locomotion) and the length change of the whole muscle tendon unit (MTU) can also be varied. Architecturally, muscles have a range of fibre lengths, maximum force-producing capabilities and stiffness of the series elastic element (SEE). In the present work we use a model to explore the relationship between power output and efficiency of a muscle across a range of contraction conditions. We have also examined the mechanical and energetic effects of changing muscle architecture within the model. Our results indicate that whilst there are clear optimal conditions for achieving maximum power output and maximum efficiency, the design of the muscle allows high levels of both to be achieved over a range of activation conditions. This range changes with both SEE compliance and the amplitude of the cyclical length change. The results suggest that a compliant SEE allows a muscle to function closer to the maximum of both power output and efficiency. In addition, by varying the amplitude of the activation level, the efficiency can theoretically remain unchanged, whilst the power output can be modulated.},

abstract = {We used a radio tracking system to examine the speed of 373 racehorses on different gradients on an undulating racecourse during 33 races, each lasting a few minutes. Horses show a speed detriment on inclines (0.68 m {\textperiodcentered} s(-1) {\textperiodcentered} 1{\%} gradient(-1), r(2) = 0.97), the magnitude of which corresponds to trading off the metabolic cost (power) of height gain with the metabolic cost (power) of horizontal galloping. A similar relationship can be derived from published data for human runners. The horses, however, were also slower on the decline (-0.45 m {\textperiodcentered} s(-1) {\textperiodcentered} 1{\%} gradient(-1), r(2) = 0.92). Human athletes run faster on a decline, which can be explained by the energy gained by the center of mass from height loss. This study has shown that horses go slower, which may be attributable to the anatomical simplicity of their front legs limiting weight support and stability when going downhill. These findings provide insight into limits to athletic performance in racehorses, which may be used to inform training regimens, as well as advancing knowledge from both veterinary and basic science perspectives.},

abstract = {Muscles are required to perform or absorb mechanical work under different conditions. However the ability of a muscle to do this depends on the interaction between its contractile components and its elastic components. In the present study we have used ultrasound to examine the length changes of the gastrocnemius medialis muscle fascicle along with those of the elastic Achilles tendon during locomotion under different incline conditions. Six male participants walked (at 5 km h(-1)) on a treadmill at grades of -10{\%}, 0{\%} and 10{\%} and ran (at 10 km h(-1)) at grades of 0{\%} and 10{\%}, whilst simultaneous ultrasound, electromyography and kinematics were recorded. In both walking and running, force was developed isometrically; however, increases in incline increased the muscle fascicle length at which force was developed. Force was developed at shorter muscle lengths for running when compared to walking. Substantial levels of Achilles tendon strain were recorded in both walking and running conditions, which allowed the muscle fascicles to act at speeds more favourable for power production. In all conditions, positive work was performed by the muscle. The measurements suggest that there is very little change in the function of the muscle fascicles at different slopes or speeds, despite changes in the required external work. This may be a consequence of the role of this biarticular muscle or of the load sharing between the other muscles of the triceps surae.},

Sports Exerc., Vol. 48, No. 11, pp. 00–00, 2016. The hyperbolic form of the power–duration relationship is rigorous and highly conserved across species, forms of exercise, and individual muscles/muscle groups. For modalities such as cycling, the relationship resolves to two parameters, the asymptote for power (critical power [CP]) and the so-called W{\P} (work doable above CP), which together predict the tolerable duration of exercise above CP. Crucially, the CP concept integrates sentinel physiological profiles—respiratory, metabolic, and contractile—within a coherent framework that has great scientific and practical utility. Rather than calibrating equivalent exercise intensities relative to metabolically distant parameters such as the lactate threshold or V˙ O2max, setting the exercise intensity relative to CP unifies the profile of systemic and intramuscular responses and, if greater than CP, predicts the tolerable duration of exercise until W{\P} is expended,V˙ O2max is attained, and intolerance is manifested. CP may be regarded as a ‘‘fatigue threshold'' in the sense that it separates exercise intensity domains within which the physiological responses to exercise can (GCP) or cannot (9CP) be stabilized. The CP concept therefore enables important insights into 1) the principal loci of fatigue development (central vs. peripheral) at different intensities of exercise and 2) mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic control and their modulation by factors such as O2 delivery. Practically, the CP concept has great potential application in optimizing athletic training programs and performance as well as improving the life quality for individuals enduring chronic disease.},

Although supporting body weight comprises the majority of the metabolic cost of running, targeting the costs of forward propulsion and leg swing are the most promising strategies for reducing the metabolic cost of running and thus improving marathon running perfor- mance. Here, we calculate how much time could be saved by taking advantage of unconventional drafting strategies, a consistent tailwind, a downhill course, and specific running shoe design features while staying within the current International Association of Athletic Federations regulations for record purposes. Specifically, running in shoes that are 100 g lighter along with second-half sce- narios of four runners alternately leading and drafting, or a tailwind of 6.0 m/s, combined with a 42-m elevation drop could result in a time well below the 2-hour mara- thon barrier.

abstract = {The steady-state isometric force following active muscle shortening or lengthening is smaller (force depression; FD) or greater (residual force enhancement; RFE) than a purely isometric contraction at the corresponding length. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not explained within the context of the cross-bridge theory and are rarely studied in concert. Previous studies have shown RFE to be speed-independent. In the present study, we investigated if RFE preceded by active shortening is time-dependent by electrically evoking RFE in the human adductor pollicis muscle. The results shown that a slow stretch following FD fully re-established RFE compared to higher speeds of stretch. The mechanism(s) responsible for the recovery of RFE following a preceding shortening contraction (FD) might be associated with the recovery of cross-bridge based force and/or the re-engagement of a passive structural element (titin). Voluntary interaction with one's environment involves highly coordinated shortening and lengthening muscle contractions. Therefore comprehending these history-dependent muscle properties in the context of movement control is paramount in understanding the behavior of in vivo motor control.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The metabolic cost of walking increases when mass is added to the legs, but the effects of load magnitude and location on the energetics and biomechanics of walking are unclear. We hypothesized that with leg loading 1) net metabolic rate would be related to the moment of inertia of the leg (I(leg)), 2) kinematics would be conserved, except for heavy foot loads, and 3) swing-phase sagittal-plane net muscle moments and swing-phase leg-muscle electromyography (EMG) would increase. METHODS: Five adult males walked on a force-measuring treadmill at 1.25 m.s(-1) with no load and with loads of 2 and 4 kg per foot and shank, 4 and 8 kg per thigh, and 4, 8, and 16 kg on the waist. We recorded metabolic rate and sagittal-plane kinematics and net muscle moments about the hip, knee, and ankle during the single-stance and swing phases, and EMG of key leg muscles. RESULTS: Net metabolic rate during walking increased with load mass and more distal location and was correlated with I(leg) (r2 = 0.43). Thigh loading was relatively inexpensive, helping to explain why the metabolic rate during walking is not strongly affected by body mass distribution. Kinematics, single-stance and swing-phase muscle moments, and EMG were similar while walking with no load or with waist, thigh, or shank loads. The increase in net metabolic rate with foot loading was associated with greater EMG of muscles that initiate leg swing and greater swing-phase muscle moments. CONCLUSIONS: Distal leg loads increase the metabolic rate required for swinging the leg. The increase in metabolic rate with more proximal loads may be attributable to a combination of supporting (via hip abduction muscles) and propagating the swing leg.},

abstract = {Similarly sized bipeds and quadrupeds use nearly the same amount of metabolic energy to run, despite dramatic differences in morphology and running mechanics. It has been shown that the rate of metabolic energy use in quadrupedal runners and bipedal hoppers can be predicted from just body weight and the time available to generate force as indicated by the duration of foot-ground contact, We tested whether this link between running mechanics and energetics also applies to running bipeds. We measured rates of energy consumption and times of foot contact for humans (mean body mass 78.88 kg) and five species of birds (mean body mass range 0.13-40.1 kg). We find that most (70-90 {\%}) of the increase in metabolic rate with speed in running bipeds can be explained by changes in the time available to generate force, The rate of force generation also explains differences in metabolic rate over the size range of birds measured. However, for a given rate of force generation, birds use on average 1.7 times more metabolic energy than quadrupeds. The rate of energy consumption for a given rate of force generation for humans is intermediate between that of birds and quadrupeds. These results support the idea that the cost of muscular force production determines the energy cost of running and suggest that bipedal runners use more energy for a given rate of force production because they require a greater volume of muscle to support their body weight.},

The coordinate system is applied to the knee and related to the commonly used clinical terms for knee joint motion. A convenient characteristic of the coordinate system shared by spatial linkages is that large joint displacements are independent of the order in which the component translations and rotations occur.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Muscular power produced during in vitro cyclic contraction has been reported to vary with muscle-length trajectory. The purpose of this study was to determine whether maximal human single-leg cycling power could be similarly altered by manipulating pedal trajectory. METHOD: Seven trained cyclists performed maximal single-leg cycle ergometry. Pedal trajectory was manipulated by repositioning the ergometer drive sprocket off-center with respect to the crank axle, such that the leg-extension phase occupied 42, 50, or 58{\%} of the cycle time (LEP42, LEP50, and LEP58, respectively). RESULTS: Maximum instantaneous power was 12{\%} greater for LEP58 (1984 +/- 143 W) than LEP50 (1838 +/- 126 W), which was 8{\%} greater than that for LEP42 (1645 +/- 112 W). Maximum power, averaged over a complete revolution of the crank, was 4{\%} greater for LEP58 (636 +/- 59 W) than for LEP50 (613 +/- 53 W), which was 18{\%} greater than that for LEP42 (520 +/- 43 W). CONCLUSIONS: These findings, paralleling those for an in vitro model, confirmed our hypothesis that maximal single-leg cycling power could be altered by manipulating pedal trajectory. Alterations in power were likely due to concomitant effects of muscle-shortening velocity, muscle excitation, and biomechanical constraints. Additional research is needed to determine whether greater leg-extension phase ratios can elicit further increases in power and whether similar results can be obtained during bilateral cycling.},

METHODS: Following a counterbalanced, cross-over design, eight professional cyclists (age (mean +/- SD): 26 +/- 2 yr, VO2max: 74.0 +/- 5.7 mL x kg x min) performed three 6-min bouts at a fixed PO (mean of 366 +/- 37 W) and at a cadence of 60, 80, and 100 rpm. RESULTS: Values of GE averaged 22.4 +/- 1.7, 23.6 +/- 1.8 and 24.2 +/- 2.0{\%} at 60, 80, and 100 rpm, respectively. Mean GE at 100 rpm was significantly higher than at 60 rpm (P {\textless} 0.05). Similarly, mean values of VO2, HR, rates of perceived exertion (RPE), lactate and normalized root-mean square EMG (rms-EMG) in both vastus lateralis and gluteus maximum muscles decreased at increasing cadences.

Exercise-induced changes in power produced by ankle, knee, and hip joint actions (joint-specific powers), however, have not been reported.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate joint-specific power production during a cycling time trial (TT) and also to compare pre- to post-TT changes in maximal cycling (MAXcyc) joint-specific powers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Ten cyclists performed MAXcyc trials (90 rpm) before and after a 10-min TT (288 ± 10 W, 90 rpm). Pedal forces and limb kinematics were determined with a force-sensing pedal and an instrumented spatial linkage, respectively. Joint-specific powers were calculated and averaged over complete pedal cycles and over extension and flexion phases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Pedal and joint-specific powers did not change during the TT. Compared to pre-TT, pedal power produced during post-TT MAXcyc was reduced by 32{\%} ± 3{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). Relative changes in ankle plantarflexion (43{\%} ± 5{\%}) and knee flexion powers (52{\%} ± 5{\%}) were similar but were greater than changes in knee extension (12{\%} ± 4{\%}) and hip extension powers (28{\%} ± 6{\%}; both P {\textless} 0.05). Pedal and joint-specific powers produced during post-TT MAXcyc were greater than those powers produced during the final 3 s of the TT (P {\textless} 0.01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Exercise-induced changes in MAXcyc power manifested with differential power loss at each joint action with ankle plantarflexion and knee flexion exhibiting relatively greater fatigue than knee extension and hip extension. However, changes in MAXcyc joint-specific powers were not presaged by changes in TT joint-specific powers. We conclude that fatigue induced via high-intensity cycling does not alter submaximal joint-specific powers but has distinct functional consequences for MAXcyc joint-specific powers.},

The dynamical equations are given in compact form and the treatment of external constraints and impact situations, such as occur at heel strike in locomotion, is discussed in depth. The practical implementation of the model is outlined and demonstrated by simulating the long-jump take-off phase of a given athlete. In contrast to other similar models, the present one not only fully accounts for the dynamics of the executor (skeletal) subsystem but also simulates in detail the intricately controlled internal excitation and contraction dynamics of the myoactuator (muscular) sybsystem. The controls in the model are the actual neural controls motor unit recruitment and stimulation rate, for each of the 46 muscles of the model. For a given set of subject-specific input parameters, a given initial state, and given neural control functions, the computer program executing the model computes the state trajectory (i.e. the resulting motion), the histories of all constraint forces, the trajectory of the centre of mass, and the histories of the components of the velocity of the centre of mass, of the total angular momentum, of all muscle and joint reaction forces, and of the energies of all 17 model segments.

The method consists of simultancously measuring both the normal and tangential pedal forces, the EMGs of eight leg muscles, and the crank arm and pedal angles. Data were recorded for three male subjects of similar anthropometric characteristics. Subjects rode under different pedalling conditions to explore how both pedal forces and pedalling rates affect the biomechanics of the pedalling process. By modelling the leg-bicycle as a five bar linkage and driving the linkage with the measured force and kinematic data, the joint moment histories due to pedal forces only (i.e. no motion) and motion only (i.e. no pedal forces) were generated. Total moments were produced by superimposing the two moment histories. The separate moment histories, together with the pedal forces and EMG results, enable a detailed biomechanical analysis of bicycle pedalling. Inasmuch as the results are similar for all three subjects, the analysis for one subject is discussed fully. One unique insight gained via this new method is the functional role that individual leg muscles play in the pedalling process. ?? 1985.},

Optimization methods could provide insight into the functional significance of muscle coordination. The purpose of this study was to predict muscle force patterns during cycling by pushing and pulling the pedal using different optimization criteria and compare the predictions with electromyographic (EMG) patterns. To address the purpose of the study, 1) the contribution of muscle length and velocity changes to EMG-muscle force relationships during cycling was examined by comparing joint moments calculated from EMG and inverse dynamics, 2) patterns of individual muscle forces during cycling of five subjects were predicted using 13 different optimization criteria, and 3) the properties of the criterion with the best performance in predicting the normalized EMG were used to explain the features and functional significance of muscle coordination in cycling. It was shown that the criterion that minimizes the sum of muscle stresses cubed demonstrated the best performance in predicting the relative magnitude and patterns of muscle activation. Based on this criterion, it was suggested that the functional significance of muscle coordination strategy in cycling may be minimization of fatigue and/or perceived effort.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to investigate for vertical jumping the relationships between muscle actions, movement pattern and jumping achievement. Ten skilled jumpers performed jumps with preparatory countermovement. Ground reaction forces and cinematographic data were recorded. In addition, myoelectric activity (EMG) was recorded from seven leg muscles. EMG-signals were rectified and low-pass filtered to obtain EMG-levels. The latter, which were assumed to reflect activation levels, rose to a plateau in the sequence m. semitendinosus, long head of m. biceps femoris, m. gluteus maximus, m. vastus medialis, m. rectus femoris, m. soleus, m. gastrocnemius. It was attempted to link the EMG-pattern to the purpose of the push-off, namely to maximize the effective energy (Ey) of the mass center of the body (MCB). The term Ey designates the sum of the potential energy of MCB and the kinetic energy due to the vertical velocity of MCB. One of the requirements for maximization of Ey is that the mono-articular extensor muscles release as much energy as possible before toe-off occurs. It is argued that this requirement can only be satisfied if the vertical velocity differences between the proximal and distal ends of body segments reach their peaks in a sequence. The sequence that is realized by the pattern of muscular activation is upper body, upper legs, lower legs, feet. Another important requirement is that the mechanical energy released by the muscles is optimally used. This requirement can be satisfied by transportation of energy via the biarticular m. rectus femoris and m. gastrocnemius. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed analysis of an optimal control solution to a maximum height squat jump, based upon how muscles accelerate and contribute power to the body segments during the ground contact phase of jumping. Quantitative comparisons of model and experimental results expose a proximal-to-distal sequence of muscle activation (i.e. from hip to knee to ankle). We found that the contribution of muscles dominates both the angular acceleration and the instantaneous power of the segments. However, the contributions of gravity and segmental motion are insignificant, except the latter become important during the final 10{\%} of the jump. Vasti and gluteus maximus muscles are the major energy producers of the lower extremity. These muscles are the prime movers of the lower extremity because they dominate the angular acceleration of the hip toward extension and the instantaneous power of the trunk. In contrast, the ankle plantarflexors (soleus, gastrocnemius, and the other plantarflexors) dominate the total energy of the thigh, though these muscles also contribute appreciably to trunk power during the final 20{\%} of the jump. Therefore, the contribution of these muscles to overall jumping performance cannot be neglected. We found that the biarticular gastrocnemius increases jump height (i.e. the net vertical displacement of the center of mass of the body from standing) by as much as 25{\%}. However, this increase is not due to any unique biarticular action (e.g. proximal-to-distal power transfer from the knee to the ankle), since jumping performance is similar when gastrocnemius is replaced with a uniarticular ankle plantarflexor. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Overuse knee joint injuries are the primary injuries to cyclists. Overuse injuries have been intuitively linked to the anatomic structure of the foot because external loads are applied to the foot in cycling. Thus, the structure and function of the foot should dictate in part how the loads are transmitted to the knee joint. Therefore, it was hypothesized that patterns in knee loads are related to the anatomic structure of the foot. To test this hypothesis, peak knee loads (dependent variables) were related to anatomical variables (independent variables) through statistical analyses. This required first the detailed evaluation (i.e. measurement) of the anatomical structure of the foot and leg for 23 subjects. Next, three-dimensional knee joint loads were determined for a standardized riding condition. The results of the statistical analyses indicated that a group of cyclists with the most extreme inversion of the forefoot relative to the transverse plane developed significantly greater average posterior knee force and extensive knee moment. In addition, a number of anatomical variables significantly accounted for the variability in peak values of the posterior force, the extensive moment, the varus/valgus moment and the external axial moment. Based on these results, the hypothesis is accepted. ?? 1992.},

The pedal force profile input is varied, maintaining constant average bicycle power, in order to obtain the optimal pedal force profile that minimizes two cost functions. One cost function is based on joint moments and the other is based on muscle stresses. Predicted (optimal) pedal profiles as well as joint moment time histories are compared to representative real data to examine cost function appropriateness. Both cost functions offer reasonable predictions of pedal forces. The muscle stress cost function, however, better predicts joint moments. Predicted muscle activity also correlates well with myolectric data. The factors that lead to effective (i.e. low cost) pedalling are examined. Pedalling effectiveness is found to be a complex function of pedal force vector orientation and muscle mechanics. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Different methods of calculating the mechanical energy cost of a movement presented in the literature can give results differing by an order of magnitude. The assumptions made concerning the transfer of energy between different parts of the body are part of the problem. This investigation assesses the role of transfer in energy saving and specifically, the possibility of two-joint muscles reducing the mechanical energy cost of a movement compared to a system having one-joint muscles only. An algorithm was developed which recruited one-joint or both one- and two-joint muscles to supply the net joint moments. The work performed under these two conditions was the compared. It was found that activation of both one- and two-joint musculature reduced the mechanical work cost during walking by between 7 and 29{\%} over that required by single-joint musculature alone. This investigation supports suggestions in the literature that one of the functions of two-joint musculature is to reduce the mechanical energy cost and probably the metabolic cost of movement. ?? 1988.},

@article{Simonsen2014,
abstract = {This thesis is based on ten published articles. The experimental work was carried out at the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen. The aim was to investigate and describe a number of basic mechanical and physiological mechanisms behind human walking. The methodologies used were biomechanical movement analysis and electrophysiology. The walking experiments were carried out in a gait lab, where the subjects were video recorded while they walked across two force platforms, which measured the ground reaction forces. Net joint moments about the hip-, knee- and ankle joint were calculated by combining the movement data and the external reaction forces (inverse dynamics). Muscle activity and sensory input to the spinal cord were measured by electromyography (EMG) and electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves. The results showed that the gait pattern varies to a great degree between individuals. Some people choose to exert the highest forces about the ankle joint while others prefer to use the knee joint. By use of a cluster analysis, fifteen healthy subjects could be divided into two groups. The extensor moment about the knee joint was the main factor for separating the two gait patterns, but the group with the highest extensor moments about the knee joint also walked with more flexed knee joints, higher EMG activity in the quadriceps muscle and higher bone-on-bone forces. This may lead to development of osteoarthritis over the years. Walking on high-heeled shoes reduced the ankle joint moment significantly either because of reduced muscle fiber length and/or increased co-contraction about the joint. On the contrary, the extensor moment about the knee joint was almost doubled in the high-heeled condition compared to bare footed walking at the same velocity. Also the EMG activity increased in the leg muscles. This could be an explanation pertaining to the higher incidence of osteoarthritis in women than in men. Patients with a drop-foot cannot put the foot to the ground with the heel first. Moreover, they have to increase flexion of the hip joint during the swing phase because the foot hangs in a plantar flexed position. It was shown that the ankle joint plantar flexor moment increased in the healthy leg and that the knee joint extensor moment increased significantly in both the affected and the healthy leg. The latter is most likely due to the patients trying to avoid an asymmetrical gait pattern. It is recommended to use an orthosis with drop-foot patients in order to keep the ankle joint dorsiflexed prior to touchdown, otherwise bone-on-bone forces in both knee joints will increase and probably lead to osteoarthritis. The hip joint moment varies less between individuals. However, both during walking and running an unexplained hip joint flexor moment is present during the last half of the stance phase. The moment appears to oppose the speed of progression and it has been suggested that it serves to balance the upper body. This was investigated in a group of healthy subjects who were asked to walk with their upper body in a reclined, inclined and normal position, respectively. It was shown that the hip joint flexor moment was similar in the reclined and the normal position but lower when walking in the inclined position and it can be concluded that the upper body is not balanced by hip joint flexor muscles but rather by accelerations of the pelvis and activity in abdominal and back muscles. These experiments also showed that the trailing leg is brought forward during the swing phase without activity in the flexor muscles about the hip joint. This was verified by the absence of EMG activity in the iliacus muscle measured by intramuscular wire electrodes. Instead the strong ligaments restricting hip joint extension are stretched during the first half of the swing phase thereby storing elastic energy, which is released during the last half of the stance phase and accelerating the leg into the swing phase. This is considered an important energy conserving feature of human walking. The gating of sensory input to the spinal cord during walking and running was investigated by use of the Hoffmann (H) reflex in m. soleus and m. gastrocnemius medialis. This reflex expresses the central component of the stretch reflex, i.e. the transmission from Ia afferents to $\alpha$-motoneurones in the spinal cord. The soleus H-reflex was shown to be strongly modulated during the gait cycle. In general, it was facilitated in the stance phase and suppressed in the swing phase. However, as it was the case with the biomechanical parameters, inter-individual H-reflex modulations were found and they were highly reproducible between days. One group of subjects had an almost completely suppressed H-reflex during the entire swing phase, while another group showed a gradually increasing reflex excitability during the swing phase. This group also walked with a lower extensor moment about the knee joint and higher plantar flexor moment about the ankle joint and it is speculated that this gait pattern highly relies on reflexes to deal with unexpected perturbations. The subjects with the suppressed reflex during the swing phase also showed a higher EMG activity in the anterior tibial muscle, so it is likely that the suppression of the H-reflex was at least partly due to reciprocal antagonist inhibition. All subjects showed complete suppression of the H-reflex at toeoff. This seems necessary to avoid a stretch reflex being elicited in the soleus muscle as the ankle joint undergoes a fast dorsiflexion just after toeoff. The reflex modulation is clearly an integrated part of the human gait pattern and is absolutely necessary for normal gait function with smoothe movements. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the afferent input from the muscle spindles is used to drive the motor output from the $\alpha$-motoneurones together with descending activity from the motor cortex. During running the H-reflex increased in both the soleus and the gastrocnemius already before heel strike and before the onset of EMG activity in the same two muscles and with a relatively high activity in the anterior tibial muscle, but this was most pronounced in the soleus. The H-reflex was always higher in the soleus also when expressed as percentage of the maximal M-wave. This is due to the difference in muscle fiber type distribution between the two muscles. The H-reflex increased from walking to running in both muscles and further with increasing running speed. Unexpectedly, there were no signs of the faster gastrocnemius becoming more important at higher running speed. During walking it is not possible to observe a stretch reflex in the form of a synchronized activation of a large number of muscle fibers as this would disturb the movement pattern. It is rather likely that the input from Ia afferents directly contributes to activate the $\alpha$-motoneurones. However, during running the stance phase is much shorter, which enables the possibility of a stretch reflex to contribute to a strong contraction during push-off. EMG peaks in the soleus with an appropriate latency were observed in the soleus during running. This was not the case with the gastrocnemius and the explanation is most likely that the gastrocnemius is biarticular and not stretched to any great extent during running.},

abstract = {In ]5 normal adults an advanced biomechanical analysis of walking patterns at slow, natural, and fast cadences showed that the ankle had two me- chanical power phases: a negative work phase dur- ing weight acceptance, followed by a dominant burst of positive work at push-off. The knee had four power phases: a negative work phase at weight acceptance, a small positive work phase during mid-stance, a major negative work burst at push-off and early swing, and a final energy- absorbing phase at the end of swing. The power phases at the hip arc quite irregular and somewhat lower than those at the knee and ankle. The dom- inant positive work burst by the plantarflexors drops as speed decreases. but less rapidly than the positive work by the knee muscles during mid- stance. The energy absorption by the quadriceps during weight acceptance decreases rapidly as speed decreases and at late stance decreases mod- erately. The energy absorption by the ankle plan- tarflexors during weight acceptance remains fairly constant at all walking speeds. and the absorption by the knee flexors at end of swing drops only slightly as cadence decreases.},

abstract = {Nice, easy to read review. Worth rereading. Begins with examination of centre of mass mechanics - differences in GRF patterns between walking and running, charecteristic mechanical energy fluctuations of CM leading to the inverted pendulum and bouncing ball paradigms (or behavioural models) of walking and running. Disusses leg geometry and leg stifness during walking and running and how it leads to maintanance of GRF at different speeds. Then joint moments, work and power are discussed - the typical profiles during walking and running are described and the general meaning is explained along with the calculation assumptions and errors. Then attempts at describing muscle-tendon mechanics are discussed. First the indertermonate problem of using inverse dynamics to correctly ascribe net moments to synergists and antagonists at a joint is explained. At the knee and hip it is impossible to determine muscle forces from different groups crossing the joints using inverse dynamics at the ankle there is little coactivation of extensor and flexor muscles during bouncing gaits therefore an inverse dynamics approach to calculating ankle extensor force yields reasonably similar values as a direct measurment of muscle-tendon force (refs 11,12,46). Studies that have investigated forces at achilles tendon in humans are cited. One shows a slight decrease or maintanance of force as walking speed is increased. Use of sonomicrometry to investigate muscle tendon length changes is highlighted. Use of optimisation criteria to use forward dynamics simulations in understanding muscle-tendon funtion during locomotion is touched upon - 'a parameter or function is assumed to be optimised by the neuromuscular system, and the pattern of muscle activation that optimises that parameter or function is identified' Unfortunately it is difficult to decide which parameter or function should be optimised. Minimisation of metabolic energy, musculoskeletal forces/stress, stability are possibilities.Notes that although optimisation of metabolic cost of locomotion can predict the speeds that humans and animals walk at, if you consider gait transition speeds it does not predict them well.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {Taking a unique approach to the presentation of mechanical concepts, "Biomechanics of Sport and Exercise, Third Edition With Web Resource and MaxTRAQ" "Educational 2D Software Access," introduces exercise and sport biomechanics in simple terms. By providing mechanics before functional anatomy, the book helps students understand forces and their effects before studying how body structures deal with forces. Students will learn to appreciate the consequences of external forces, how the body generates internal forces to maintain position, and how forces create movement in physical activities. Rather than presenting the principles as isolated and abstract, the text enables students to discover the principles of biomechanics for themselves through observation. By examining ordinary activities firsthand, students will develop meaningful explanations resulting in a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanical concepts. This practical approach combines striking visual elements with clear and concise language to encourage active learning and improved comprehension. This updated edition maintains the organization and features that made previous editions user friendly, such as a quick reference guide of frequently used equations printed on the inside cover and review questions at the end of each chapter to test students' understanding of important concepts. The third edition also incorporates new features to facilitate learning: - Access to MaxTRAQ Educational 2D software allows students to analyze real-world sport movements through video. - The new web resource guides students step by step through the process of solving 10 sample problems. - New art and diagrams enhance problem sets and help students visualize the mechanics of real-world scenarios. - Increased number of review questions (200) and problem sets (120) provide an opportunity for practical application of concepts. - Greater emphasis on the basics, including improved descriptions of conversions and an expanded explanation of the assumption of point mass when modeling objects, provides a stronger foundation for understanding. - New content on deriving kinematic data from video or film and the use of accelerometers in monitoring physical activity keeps students informed of technological advances in the field. "Biomechanics of Sport and Exercise, Third Edition With Web Resource and MaxTRAQ Educational 2D Software Access," is supplemented with two companion resources that will help students better comprehend the material. The web resource includes all of the problems from the book, separated by chapter, plus 18 sample problems that guide students step by step through the process of solving. This text is also enhanced with access to MaxTRAQ Educational 2D software for Windows. MaxTRAQ Educational 2D software enables students to analyze and quantify real-world sport movements in video clips and upload their own video content for analysis. The software supplements the final section of the text that bridges the concepts of internal and external forces with the application of biomechanics; it also provides an overview of the technology used in conducting quantitative biomechanical analyses. Access to both online resources is included with new print books. To purchase the components separately, click on the web resource under "Related Products" in the right column. Instructors will benefit from an updated ancillary package. An instructor guide outlines each chapter and offers step-by-step solutions to the quantitative problems presented, as well as sample lecture topics, student activities, and teaching tips. A test package makes it easy to prepare quizzes and tests, and an image bank contains most of the figures and tables from the text for use in developing course presentations. "Biomechanics of Sport and Exercise, Third Edition," is ideal for those needing a deeper understanding of biomechanics from a qualitative perspective. Thoroughly updated and expanded, this text makes the biomechanics of physical activity easy to understand and apply.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the physiological capacities and performance of professional road cyclists in relation to their morphotype-dependent speciality. METHODS: 24 world-class cyclists, classified as flat terrain (FT, N = 5), time trial (TT, N = 4), all terrain (AT, N = 6). and uphill (UH, N = 9) specialists, completed an incremental laboratory cycling test to assess maximal power output (Wmax), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), lactate threshold (LT), and onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA). RESULTS: UH had a higher frontal area (FA):body mass (BM) ratio (5.23 +/- 0.09 m2 x kg(-1) x 10(-3)) than FT and TT (P {\textless} 0.05). FT showed the highest absolute Wmax (481 +/- 18 W), and UH the highest Wmax relative to BM (6.47 +/- 0.33 W x kg(-1)). WLT and W(OBLA) values were significantly higher in FT (356 +/- 41 and 417 +/- 45 W) and TT (357 +/- 41 and 409 +/- 46 W) than in UH (308 +/- 46 and 356 +/- 41). Scaling of these values relative to FA and BM exponents 0.32 and 0.79 minimized group differences, but considerable differences among mean group values remained. FT and TT had the highest Wmax per FA unit (1300 +/- 62 and 1293 +/- 57 W x m2), whereas TT had the highest absolute W x kg(-0.32) and W x kg(-0.79), as well as W x kg(-0.32), W x kg(-0.79), and W x m2 at the LT and OBLA. CONCLUSIONS: i) Scaling of maximal and submaximal physiological values showed a performance advantage of TT over FT, AT, and UH in all cycling terrains and conditions; and ii) mass exponents of 0.32 and 1 were the most appropriate to evaluate level and uphill cycling ability, respectively, whereas absolute Wmax values are recommended for performance-prediction in short events on level terrain, and W(LT) and W(OBLA) in longer time trials and uphill cycling.},

We describe the software architecture, sensitivity analyses to minimise delays and errors, and compare offline and real-time results. This system has the potential to strongly impact current rehabilitation practices enabling the use of personalised musculoskeletal models in real-time.},

abstract = {Joint moments are of interest because they bear some relation to muscular effort and hence rider performance. The general objective of this study is to explore the relation between joint moments and pedalling rate (i.e. cadence). Joint moments are computed by modelling the leg-bicycle system as a five-bar linkage constrained to plane motion. Using dynamometer pedal force data and potentiometer crank and pedal position data, system equations are solved on a computer to produce moments at the ankle, knee and hip joints. Cadence and pedal forces are varied inversely to maintain constant power. Results indicate that average joint moments vary considerably with changes in cadence. Both hip and knee joints show an average moment which is minimum near 105 rotations min-1 for cruising cycling. It appears that an optimum rotations min-1 can be determined from a mechanical approach for any given power level and bicycle-rider geometry. ?? 1986.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the degree$\backslash$nto which ankle joint power overestimates net plantarflexor MTU power$\backslash$nduring the Push-off phase of walking, due to the behavior of the flexor$\backslash$ndigitorum and hallucis longus (FDHL)-multiarticular MTUs crossing the$\backslash$nankle and metatarsophalangeal (toe) joints.$\backslash$nMethods$\backslash$nWe performed a gait analysis study on six healthy participants,$\backslash$nrecording ground reaction forces, kinematics, and electromyography$\backslash$n(EMG).

In this review, we describe the power–duration (PD) relationship across the full range of attainable power outputs in humans. We show that a remarkably small range of power outputs is sustainable (power outputs below the critical power, CP). We also show that the origin of neuromuscular fatigue differs considerably depending on the exercise intensity domain in which exercise is performed. In the moderate domain (below the lactate threshold, LT), fatigue develops slowly and is predominantly of central origin (residing in the central nervous system). In the heavy domain (above LT but below CP), both central and peripheral (muscle) fatigue are observed. In this domain, fatigue is frequently correlated with the depletion of muscle glycogen. Severe-intensity exercise (above the CP) is associated with progressive derangements of muscle metabolic homeostasis and consequent peripheral fatigue. To counter these effec...},

abstract = {Cycling performance is affected by the interaction of a number of variables, including environment, mechanical, and human factors. Engineers have focused on the development of more efficient bicycles. Kinesiologists have examined cycling performance from a human perspective. This paper summarizes only certain aspects of human ergonomics of cycling, especially those which are important for the recent current research in our departments. Power is a key to performance of physical work. During locomotion an imaginary flow of energy takes place from the metabolism to the environment, with some efficiency. The 'useful' mechanical muscle power output might be used to perform movements and to do work against the environment. The external power is defined as the sum of joint powers, each calculated as the product of the joint (net) moment and angular velocity. This definition of external power is closely related to the mean external power as applied to exercise physiology: the sum of joint powers reflects all mechanical power which in principle can be used to fulfil a certain task. In this paper, the flow of energy for cycling is traced quantitatively as far as possible. Studies on the total lower limb can give insight into the contribution of individual muscles to external power. The muscle velocity (positive or negative) is obtained from the positions and orientations of body segments and a bar linkage model of the lower limb. The muscle activity can be measured by electromyography. In this way, positive and negative work regions in individual muscles are identified. Synergy between active agonistic/antagonistic muscle groups occurs in order to deliver external power. Maximum power is influenced by body position, geometry of the bicycle and pedalling rate. This has to be interpreted in terms of the length-tension and force-velocity-power relationships of the involved muscles. Flat road and uphill cycling at different saddle-tube angles is simulated on an ergometer. The measured pedal forces (magnitude and direction) are only dependent on the intersegmental orientation of saddle tube, crank position, upper and lower leg, and foot. The changed direction of the gravitational force with respect to the saddle-tube does not interfere with the co-ordinated force production pattern. During locomotory cycling at constant speed the external power is mainly used to overcome the aerodynamic friction force. This force and the rolling resistance are determined by coasting down experiments, yielding the external power.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The bicycle, a simple toy to many, turns out to be an excellent platform to study the intricacies of vehicle dynamics, human-machine interaction, and human operator control for both academic and economical reasons. The bicycle is inherently unstable at low speeds and the human generally actuates the non-minimum phase system, and thus balances, only by means of rotating the handlebars. This dissertation describes a multi-year multi-person effort to better understand the dynamics of the bicycle, the biomechanics of the rider, and the rider's internal control system through theory and extensive experimentation. The chapters herein focus on the development of open loop bicycle models, some of which include the rider's biomechanics, the resulting predicted motion and model characteristics, the accurate measurement and estimation of both the bicycle and rider's physical parameters, observation of a rider's control motions, the development of experimental bicycles capable of measuring kinematics and forces, control theory including that of the human operator, and finally the identification of the both the plant and controller of the bicycle-rider system. The work has revealed a number of interesting conclusions including the primary biomechanic actuators used by the human in control, effects of the rider's motion and constraints on bicycle stability, the inadequacy of the Whipple bicycle model, and the ability of a simple multi-output control system based on the classical crossover model to describe the human's control efforts while being externally perturbed. These findings have implications in both single track vehicle design and human-machine interaction theory. Future applications may be able to utilize the methods and results to help objectively design bicycles with improved handling, stability, and controllability whereas human operator research may be able to build on the validated crossover model theory of manual control.},

abstract = {1. Movements often require control of direction and a magnitude of force exerted externally on the environment. Bi-articular upper leg muscles appear to play a unique role in the regulation of the net torques about the hip and knee joints, necessary for the control of this external force. 2. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the mono-articular muscles act as work generators in powerful dynamic leg extensions, which means that they should be activated primarily in the phases during which they can contribute to work, irrespective of the net joint torques required to control the external force. 3. Cycling movements of six trained subjects were analysed by means of inverse dynamics, yielding net joint torques as well as activity patterns and shortening velocities of four mono- and four bi-articular leg muscles. 4. The results show that the mono-articular muscles exert force only in the phase in which these muscles shorten, whereas this appears not to be the case for the bi-articular muscles. 5. Reciprocal patterns of activation of the rectus femoris and hamstring muscles appear to tune the distribution of net joint torques about the hip and knee joints, necessary to control the (changing) direction of the force on the pedal. 6. An analysis of running in man and additional related literature based on animal studies appears to provide further support for the hypothesis that mono- and bi-articular muscles have essentially different roles in these powerful multijoint leg extension tasks.},

abstract = {Studies have indicated that the muscles work in a systematic and coordinated way to generate and direct power from the human body to the crank during cycling. Understanding of the muscle involvement or recruitment pattern during cycling will be useful for developing specific and effective muscle training and rehabilitation programs for cyclists. Moreover, it will also facilitate the use of the cycling ergometer for therapeutic purpose. This paper reviews the current literature on muscle recruitment pattern during cycling and the effects of muscle fatigue, cadence, riding posture and seat height on this recruitment pattern. In the power phase or 'downstroke', the hip, knee and ankle joints extend simultaneously for the pushing action, whilst in the recovery phase or 'upstroke', they flex together to pull the pedal back to the top dead center of the crank cycle. Recent studies have indicated that in this repeated sequence, the mono-articular muscles are mainly involved in the generation of positive work whereas the biarticular muscles are responsible for regulating force transmission. Some muscles co-activate during cycling to provide synergistic actions and other functional needs. Muscle fatigue is an important factor affecting cycling performance. It has been reported that muscle fatigue in the lower body would alter the cycling motion and muscle activation pattern. Therefore, studying the change of muscle activation pattern during cycling at the fatigued level may shed light on the sequel of local muscle fatigue. A muscle training program specifically for cycling can then be designed accordingly. Additionally, the change of cadence during cycling will affect the muscle recruitment pattern. There is a unique cadence that minimizes the muscle activation level at a specific level of power output. This cadence will increase as the power output increases. The change of riding posture from sitting to standing renders the pelvis unsupported and the body weight will assist the power phase of pedalling. Similarly, changes to the seat height will alter the posture which will affect the directions of muscle actions to the crank, thus changing the muscle recruitment pattern. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the factors explaining the sit-stand transition in cycling are unclear. This study investigated if biomechanical and/or muscle activation cost functions could predict the power at which the spontaneous sit-stand transition occurs. Twenty-five participants performed an incremental test leading to the sit-to-stand transition, and subsequent randomized pedaling trials at 20 to 120{\%} of the transition power in seated and standing position. A Moment Cost Function based on lower limbs net joint moments and two Electromyographic Cost Functions based on EMG data were defined. All cost functions increased with increasing crank power (p {\textless} 0.001) but at different rates in the seated and standing positions. They had lower values in the seated position below the transition power and lower values in the standing position above the transition power (p {\textless} 0.05). These results suggest that spontaneous change of position observed in cycling with increasing crank power represents an optimal choice to minimize muscular efforts. These results support the use of simple cost functions to define optimal settings in cycling and to assess the cost of cycling during short-term efforts.},

The review is organized into four sections: proposing, conducting, analysing and reporting research. In the first of these, we emphasize the importance of defining a worthy research question and of planning the study before its implementation to prevent later difficulties in the analysis and interpretation of data. In the second section, we cover selection of trial sizes and suggest that using three trials or more may be beneficial to provide more 'representative' and valid data. The third section on analysis of data concentrates on effect size statistics, qualitative and numerical trend analysis and cross-correlations. As sample sizes are often small, the use of effect size is recommended to support the results of statistical significance testing. In using cross-correlations, we recommend that scatterplots of one variable against the other, with the identified time lag included, be inspected to confirm that the linear relationship assumption underpinning this statistic is met and, if appropriate, that a linearity transformation be applied. Finally, we consider important information related to the issues above that should be included when reporting research. We recommend reporting checks or corrections for violations of underpinning assumptions, and the effect of these checks or corrections, to assist in advancing knowledge in biomechanics and motor control.},

While steady locomotion at a given speed requires no net mechanical work, moving faster does demand both more positive and negative mechanical work per stride. Is this increased demand met by increasing power output at all lower limb joints or just some of them? Does running rely on different joints for power output than walking? How does this contribute to the metabolic cost of locomotion? This study examined the effects of walking and running speed on lower limb joint mechanics and metabolic cost of transport in humans. Kinematic and kinetic data for 10 participants were collected for a range of walking (0.75, 1.25, 1.75, 2.0 m s(-1)) and running (2.0, 2.25, 2.75, 3.25 m s(-1)) speeds. Net metabolic power was measured by indirect calorimetry. Within each gait, there was no difference in the proportion of power contributed by each joint (hip, knee, ankle) to total power across speeds. Changing from walking to running resulted in a significant (p = 0.02) shift in power production from the hip to the ankle which may explain the higher efficiency of running at speeds above 2.0 m s(-1) and shed light on a potential mechanism behind the walk-run transition.},

Fourteen male cyclists completed repeated cycling trials on a motorised treadmill whilst riding their own bicycle fitted with a mobile ergometer. The speed, gradient and loading via an external pulley system were recorded during 20-s constant speed trials and used to estimate power output with an assumption about the contribution of rolling resistance. These values were then compared with mobile ergometer measurements. To assess the reliability of measured power output values, four repeated trials were conducted on each cyclist. During level cycling, the recorded power output was 257.2 +/- 99.3 W compared to the predicted power output of 258.2 +/- 99.9 W (p {\textgreater} 0.05). For graded cycling, there was no significant difference between measured and predicted power output, 268.8 +/- 109.8 W vs. 270.1 +/- 111.7 W, p {\textgreater} 0.05, SEE 1.2 {\%}.

Muscle activation of QF-muscles during MVC was estimated using surface electromyography (EMG). Moments and EMG data of each subject were normalized to the largest value produced at any knee joint position [{\%} Max.]. No significant differences in the normalized [{\%} Max.] moment-knee angle relation of the QF were found between endurance runners, cyclists and triathletes. Despite few unsystematic exceptions, no functional differences in the normalized moment-knee angle relation of the QF occurred among tennis players and the endurance-oriented athletic groups. Obtained by curve fitting, the optimal knee joint angle for moment production was not significantly different among all athletic groups. We conclude that long-term competitive endurance running, cycling, triathlon and tennis do not provoke functional differences in the moment-knee angle relation of the whole QF.},

abstract = {This paper critically reviews technique analysis as an analytical method used within sports biomechanics as a part of performance analysis. The concept of technique as 'a specific sequence of movements' appears to be well established in the literature, but the concept of technique analysis is less well developed. Although several descriptive and analytical goals for technique analysis can be identified, the main justification given for its use is to aid in the improvement of performance. However, the conceptual framework underpinning this process is poorly developed with a lack of distinction between technique and performance. The methods of technique analysis have been divided into qualitative, quantitative and predictive components. Qualitative technique analysis is characterized by observation and subjective judgement. Several aids to observation are identified, including phase analysis, temporal analysis and critical feature analysis. Although biomechanical principles of movement can be used to form judgements about technique, little agreement exists about the number and categories of these principles. A 'deterministic' model can be used to identify factors that affect performance but, in doing so, technique variables are frequently overlooked. Quantitative technique analysis relies on biomechanical data collection methods. The identification of key technique variables that affect performance is a major issue, but these are poorly distinguished from other variables that affect performance. Quantitative analysis is not suitable for establishing the characteristics of the whole skill, but new methods, such as the use of artificial neural networks, are described that may be able to overcome this limitation. Other methods based on modelling and computer simulation also have potential for focusing on the whole skill. Predictive technique analysis encompasses these developments and offers an attractive interface between the scientist and coach through visual animation methods. I conclude that biomechanists need to clarify the underpinning rationale, framework and scope for the various approaches to technique analysis.},

Bilateral pedalling asymmetry indices of force and EMG were also determined in this study. Twelve healthy cyclists were recruited for this study and tested for force output and EMG during steady state cycling adopting different pedalling and handle bar postures. The standing posture increased the maximal stepping torque (posture 1: 204.2 ± 47.0 Nm; posture 2: 212.5 ± 46.1 Nm; posture 3: 561.5 ± 143.0 Nm; posture 4: 585.5 ± 139.1 Nm), stepping work (posture 1: 655.2 ± 134.6 Nm; posture 2: 673.2 ± 116.3 Nm; posture 3: 1852.3 ± 394.4 Nm; posture 4: 1911.3 ± 432.9 Nm), and handle force (posture 1: 16.6 ± 3.6 N; posture 2: 16.4 ± 3.6 N; posture 3: 26.5 ± 8.2 N; posture 4: 41.4 ± 11.1 N), as well as muscle activation (posture 1: 13.6-25.1{\%}; posture 2: 13.0-23.9{\%}; posture 3: 23.6-61.8{\%}; posture 4: 22.5-65.8{\%}) in the erector spine, rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, and soleus. However, neither a sitting nor a standing riding posture affected the hamstring. The riding asymmetry was detected between the right and left legs only in sitting conditions. When a cyclist changes posture from sitting to standing, the upper and lower extremities are forced to produce more force output because of the shift in body weight. These findings suggest that cyclists can switch between sitting and standing postures during competition to increase cycling efficiency in different situations. Furthermore, coaches and trainers can modify sitting and standing durations to moderate cycling intensity, without concerning unbalanced muscle development.},

abstract = {The length dependence of force development of mammalian skeletal muscles was evaluated during twitch, double-pulse, and tetanic contractions, and the relation between muscle length and the time-dependent characteristics of twitch and double-pulse contractions were determined. In situ isometric contractions of the rat gastrocnemius muscle were analyzed at seven different lengths, based on a reference length at which the maximal response to double-pulse contractions occurred (Lopt-2P). Twitch and double-pulse contractions were analyzed for developed tension (DT), contraction time (tC), average rate of force development (DT-tC(-1)), half-relaxation time (t50{\%}R), peak rate of relaxation (DT x dtmin(-1)), and 90{\%}-relaxation time (t90{\%}R). Considering the length at which maximal tetanic DT occurred to be the optimal length (Lo-TET), the peak DT for twitch contractions and double-pulse contractions was observed at Lo-TET + 0.75 mm (p {\textless} 0.05) and Lo-TET + 0.1 mm (p {\textgreater} 0.05), respectively. When measured at the length for which maximal twitch and double-pulse contractions were obtained, tetanic DT was 95.2 +/- 3 and 99.0 +/- 2{\%} of the maximal value, respectively. These observations suggest that double-pulse contractions are more suitable for setting length for experimental studies than twitch contractions. Twitch and double-pulse contraction tC were 15.53 +/- 1.14 and 25.0 +/- 0.6 ms, respectively, at Lopt-2P, and increased above Lopt-2P and decreased below Lopt-2P. Twitch t50{\%}R was 12.18 +/- 0.90 ms at Lopt-2P, and increased above Lopt-2P and below Lopt-2P. Corresponding changes for double-pulse contractions were greater. Stretching the muscle leads to slower twitch contractions and double-pulse contractions, but the mechanisms of this change in time course remain unclear.},

abstract = {Reasons for performing study: The relationship between the biomechanical horse–rider interaction and endurance race performance requires further investigation. Objectives: To characterise, both quantitatively and qualitatively, elite and advanced horse–rider dyads on the basis of the biomechanical horse–rider interaction during endurance races. Study design: Five elite and 5 advanced horse–rider dyads were recorded during CEI*/CEI** endurance races using 2 synchronised triaxial accelerometers each placed close to horse and rider centres of mass. Methods: For each horse–rider dyad, analyses focused on the vertical displacements of horse and rider per stride. This allowed quantification of the proportional use of each gait and riding technique per loop. The quality of the biomechanical horse–rider interaction was examined through the relative phases (RP) of their respective vertical displacement minima. Instantaneous speed and rider heart rates were recorded using a global positioning system device/heart rate monitor. Results: All dyads predominantly used 2 riding techniques per gait. The 2-point trot proportion was limited in both groups (11{\%}). Throughout the race, the advanced horse–rider dyads showed a global stability in speed, in the proportion of 4 combinations of gait and riding techniques and in mean RP. However, the elite horse–rider dyads initially had higher mean RP values (P{\textless}0.01), and from mid-race to the end an increasing proportion of sitting canter, with associated increases in racing speed (P{\textless}0.001) and in mean heart rate (P{\textless}0.01). Intradyad RP variability in 2-point canter increased in both groups (P{\textless}0.01). Conclusions: Accelerometers are a valuable tool to follow the quantitative and qualitative trends of the biomechanical horse–rider interaction during international endurance races. The overall results emphasise the influence of the level of expertise on the adopted gait and riding techniques, thus influencing the racing speed. It remains to be established whether fatigue and/or strategy underlie our observations.},

abstract = {Non-circular chainrings have been reported to alter the crank angular velocity profile over a pedal revolution so that more time is spent in the effective power phase. The purpose of this study was to determine whether sprint cycling performance could be improved using a non-circular chainring (Osymetric: ellipticity 1.25 and crank lever mounted nearly perpendicular to the major axis), in comparison with a circular chainring. Twenty sprint cyclists performed an 8 s sprint on a cycle ergometer against a 0.5 N/kg(-1) friction force in four crossing conditions (non-circular or circular chainring with or without clipless pedal). Instantaneous force, velocity and power were continuously measured during each sprint. Three main characteristic pedal downstrokes were selected: maximal force (in the beginning of the sprint), maximal power (towards the middle), and maximal velocity (at the end of the sprint). Both average and instantaneous force, velocity and power were calculated during the three selected pedal downstrokes. The important finding of this study was that the maximal power output was significantly higher (+ 4.3{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05) when using the non-circular chainring independent from the shoe-pedal linkage condition. This improvement is mainly explained by a significantly higher instantaneous external force that occurs during the downstroke. Non-circular chainring can have potential benefits on sprint cycling performance. Key pointsThe Osymetric non-circular chainring significantly maximized crank power by 4.3{\%} during sprint cycling, in comparison with a circular chainring.This maximal power output improvement was due to significant higher force developed when the crank was in the effective power phase.This maximal power output improvement was independent from the shoe-pedal linkage condition.Present benefits provided by the non-circular chainring on pedalling kinetics occurred only at high cadences.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that compared to upright posture, slower oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics resulting from exercise at the same relative metabolic load in the supine posture will be associated with increased muscle de-oxygenation and greater myoelectrical activity. Nine subjects completed one 12-min heavy-intensity constant-load exercises in each of the supine and upright postures on an electronically braked cycle ergometer at a same gain in metabolism per unit increase in work intensity (10.8 ± 1.3 vs. 11.8 ± 1.1 mlO2{\textperiodcentered}min(-1){\textperiodcentered}W(-1) in upright and supine, respectively) on separate days. Breath-by-breath VO2 kinetics were analyzed with a double exponential model to characterize the primary and slow component phases. Myoelectrical activity (RMS) of the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris, and biceps femoris muscles was recorded at different epochs of the exercise. Oxygenation of the VL muscle was recorded continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy. In supine compared with upright cycling, the primary time constant of VO2 kinetics was significantly increased (32.7 ± 10.7 s vs. 23.5 ± 6.7 s, respectively) while the absolute magnitude of VO2 slow component was decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) but not the relative amplitude. VL de-oxygenation was higher (p {\textless} 0.05) in supine cycling throughout the exercising period whereas RMS values for all muscles did not change appreciably over time. Our findings suggest that lowered oxygen supply induced by supine heavy exercise, alters oxidative metabolism dynamics and increases muscle de-oxygenation. However, cycling supine did not increase markedly the rate of muscle fatigue. Key PointsHydrostatic pressure gradients in blood vessels oriented longitudinally in the body are lesser in supine than in upright posture.Lowered oxygen supply induced with supine exercise slows oxidative metabolism dynamics and increases muscle de-oxygenation during heavy exercise.Compared to upright, supine exercise did not increase markedly the rate of muscle fatigue at a same relative metabolic load.},

These field measurements can be performed with very good accuracy and reliability making the power meter a useful tool for monitoring and evaluating training and race demands. This review presents power meter data from a Grand Tour cyclist's training and racing and explores the inherent complications created by its stochastic nature. Simple summary methods cannot reflect a session's variable distribution of power output or indicate its likely metabolic stress. Binning power output data, into training zones for example, provides information on the detail but not the length of efforts within a session. An alternative approach is to track changes in cyclists' modelled training and racing performances. Both critical power and record power profiles have been used for monitoring training-induced changes in this manner. Due to the inadequacy of current methods, the review highlights the need for new methods to be established which quantify the effects of training loads and models their implications for performance.},

abstract = {While medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus (SOL) are considered synergists, they are anatomically exclusive in that SOL crosses only the ankle, while MG crosses both the knee and ankle. Due to the force-length properties of both active and passive structures, activation of SOL and MG must be constantly regulated to provide the required joint torques for any planned movement. As such, the aim of this study was to investigate the neural regulation of MG and SOL when independently changing their length by changing only the knee joint angle, thus exclusively altering the length of MG fibers. MG and SOL motor units (MU) were recorded intramuscularly along with ultrasound imaging of MG and SOL fascicle lengths, while moving the knee through 60° of rotation and maintaining a low level of voluntary plantar flexor torque. The results showed a reciprocal activation of MG and SOL as the knee was moved into flexion and extension. A clear reduction in MG MU firing rates occurred as the knee was flexed (MG fascicles shortening), with de-recruitment of most MG MU occurring at close to full knee flexion. A concomitant increase in SOL MU activity was observed while no change in the length of its fascicles was found. The opposite effects were found when the knee was moved into extension. A strong correlation (ICC = 0.78) was found between the fascicle length at which MG MUs were de-recruited and subsequently re-recruited. This was stronger than the relationship of de-recruitment and re-recruitment with knee angle (ICC = 0.52), indicating that in this instance, muscle fascicle length rather than joint angle is more influential in regulating MG recruitment. Such a reciprocal arrangement like the one presented here for SOL and MG is essential for human voluntary movements such as walking or cycling.},

abstract = {The work done at each step during level walking and running to lift the centre of mass of the body, Wv, and to increase its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2-32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At intermediate speeds of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ - Wext)/(/Wv/ + /Wf/): it attains a maximum (about 65{\%}) at intermediate speeds. 4. A simple model, assuming that in walking the body rotates as an inverted pendulum over the foot in contact with the ground, fits the experimental data better at intermediate speeds but is no longer tenable above 7 km/hr. 5. In running the recovery defined above is minimal (0-4{\%} independent of speed), i.e. Wext congruent to /Wv/ + /Wf/: potential and kinetic energy of the body do not interchange but are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with a rate increasing markedly with the speed (from about 1 to 4 h.p.). 6. Wext increases linearly with the running speed Vf from a positive y intercept owing to the fact that Wv is practically constant independent of Vf. On the contrary, Wf = aVf2/(1 + bVf), where b is the ratio between the time spent in the air and the forward distance covered while on the ground during each step.},

abstract = {1. Action potentials recorded by surface electrodes from voluntary contrac- tions of the human gastrocnemius were integrated electronically during isotonic shortening and lengthening of the muscle. 2. Comparison was made of the results obtained with surface and needle electrodes. 3. At constant velocity of shortening or lengthening, the electrical activity was directly proportional to the tension, the slope of this relation being less in lengthening. 4. At constant tension, the electrical activity increased linearly with velocity of shortening, but remained almost independent of speed when the muscle was being lengthened. The relation held over the range of velocities possible in the experiments described, but would not be expected to do so at higher velocities. This result could be predicted from Hill's force-velocity equation. 5. Force-velocity curves obtained from a muscle excited by a constant submaximal stimulus (as indicated by constant electrical activity) agreed with the equation (P+a)V= (PO-P) b over the narrow range of force and velocity possible in such experiments. A similar result could be derived by interpolating for the results under (3) and (4) above. 6. Tension, velocity and electrical activity are thus interdependent, and integration of the electrical record provides a composite measure of the number of active fibres and their frequency of excitation.},

@article{Marsh1998,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether an association exists between peripheral comfort level, as reflected by differentiated RPE measures, and the preferred cadences of subjects who differed in cycling experience and fitness level. METHODS: Twelve experienced cyclists (C), ten runners (R), and ten less-trained noncyclists (LT), all of whom were male, pedaled at three power outputs (C, R: 100, 150, 200 W; LT: 75, 100, 150 W) and six cadences (50, 65, 80, 95, 110 rpm, and their freely chosen cadence) for 5 min per condition. Differentiated ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded during the fifth minute of the exercise. It was hypothesized that the preferred cadence selected by C, R, and LT would be the same as the cadence at which the peripheral RPE was minimized. Comparison of means failed to support this hypothesis. RESULTS: Irrespective of rating scale (peripheral, central, overall), the cadences at which RPE was minimized were lower than the preferred cadences, except for LT at 150 W, where there was no significant difference between the preferred cadence and the cadences at which the peripheral and overall RPE were minimized. C tended toward a more curvilinear RPE-cadence relationship compared with R and LT. Mean data for all groups showed that only the peripheral RPE decreased from 50 to 65 rpm, whereas peripheral, overall, and central RPE remained essentially unchanged from 65 to 80 rpm but increased from 80 to 110 rpm. There was a trend for the cadences at which RPE was minimized for C to be higher than the cadences that minimized RPE in either R or LT. For all groups, the cadences at which peripheral RPE was minimized were significantly higher than the cadences at which either the overall or central ratings were minimized. CONCLUSION: The small magnitudes of change in the RPE score across cadence, particularly in C and R, suggest that RPE may not be a critical variable in cadence selection during submaximal power output cycling.},

@article{Minetti1994,
abstract = {Five subjects walked and ran at overlapping speeds and different gradients on a motorized treadmill. At each gradient the speed was obtained at which walking and running have the same metabolic cost (Sm) and the speed of spontaneous (Ss) transition between the two gaits was measured. Ss was found to be statistically lower than Sm at all gradients, the difference being in the range of 0.5-0.9 km h-1. The motion analysis of walking reveals that at all gradients and at increasing speed: (1) the percentage of recovery, an index of mechanical energy saving related to the pendulum-like characteristic of walking, decreases; (2) the lower limb spread reaches a limit in walking; and consequently (3) both the stride frequency and the internal mechanical work, due to limb acceleration in relation to the body centre of mass, increase much more in walking than in running. Switching to a run, although implying a higher frequency, makes the internal work decrease as a result of the lower limb spread. In this paper several influences, such as the 'ratings of perceived exertion' (RPE), on the choice of beginning to run when it is more economical to walk, are discussed. A tentative hypothesis on the determinants of Ss, which is emphasized to be a speed which has to be studied in detail but is generally avoided in locomotion, is based on a comfort criterion from peripheric afferences and is reflected by the fact that at Ss a running stride costs as much as a walking stride.},

abstract = {Technique and energy saving are two variables often considered as important for performance in cycling and related to each other. Theoretically, excellent pedalling technique should give high gross efficiency (GE). The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between pedalling technique and GE. 10 well-trained cyclists were measured for GE, force effectiveness (FE) and dead centre size (DC) at a work rate corresponding to {\~{}}75{\%} of VO(2)max during level and inclined cycling, seat adjusted forward and backward, at three different cadences around their own freely chosen cadence (FCC) on an ergometer. Within subjects, FE, DC and GE decreased as cadence increased (p {\textless} 0.001). A strong relationship between FE and GE was found, which was to great extent explained by FCC. The relationship between cadence and both FE and GE, within and between subjects, was very similar, irrespective of FCC. There was no difference between level and inclined cycling position. The seat adjustments did not affect FE, DC and GE or the relationship between them. Energy expenditure is strongly coupled to cadence, but force effectiveness, as a measure for pedalling technique, is not likely the cause of this relationship. FE, DC and GE are not affected by body orientation or seat adjustments, indicating that these parameters and the relationship between them are robust to coordinative challenges within a range of cadence, body orientation and seat position that is used in regular cycling.},

The internal mechanical work was calculated as the sum of the increments of kinetic and potential energy in all body segments by using methods of film analysis. Total energy consumption was measured by combining aerobic and anaerobic energy production. When the power output of the bicycle ergometer was increased from 146 +/- 15 to 283 +/- 17 W, oxygen consumption increased from 2.20 +/- 0.98 to 4.22 +/- 0.20 l min-1 (P less than 0.001), while the oxygen consumption at rest was 0.30 +/- 0.03 l min-1. The concentration of blood lactate increased from 2.2 +/- 0.4 at the lowest work load to 8.6 +/- 1.2 mmol l-1 at the highest work load (P less than 0.001). The amount of external work done per revolution increased from 139 +/- 20 to 277 +/- 29 J (P less than 0.001), while the amount of internal work per revolution remained almost constant (56 +/- 12 J).

abstract = {In this study, the force-length characteristics of the in vivo medial (GM) and lateral (GL) heads of the human gastrocnemius muscle were estimated from measurements in eight healthy male subjects. This involved: 1) dynamometry-based measurements of the moment generated during maximal isometric plantar flexion; 2) ultrasound-based measurements of fascicular length and pennation angle; and 3) ultrasound-based calculations of moment arm lengths. All measurements were taken over the ankle angle range from 20 degrees of dorsiflexion to 30 degrees of plantar flexion. Tendon forces were calculated by dividing the moments recorded by the muscle moment arm lengths, and fascicular forces were calculated by dividing the tendon forces estimated by the cosine of pennation angle. In the transition from 30 degrees of plantar flexion to 20 degrees of dorsiflexion, the GM muscle fascicular length and force increased linearly from 24 to 39 mm and from 222 to 931 N, respectively. Over the same ankle angle range, the GL muscle fascicular length and force increased linearly from 30 to 47 mm and from 139 to 393 N, respectively. Estimates of the sarcomeric lengths corresponding to the fascicular lengths measured indicated that the two muscles operated in the range 1.4-2.2 microm, below the optimal length region for force generation according to the cross-bridge mechanism of contraction. These results indicate that the force-length relation of the in vivo human gastrocnemius muscle is limited to the ascending limb of the bell-shaped force-length curve obtained from experiments on isolated material.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that limit the speed at which striated muscles relax are poorly understood. This work presents, to our knowledge, novel simulations that show that the time course of relaxation is accelerated by interfilamentary movement resulting from series compliance; force drops faster when myosin heads move relative to actin during relaxation. This insight was obtained by using cross-bridge distribution techniques to simulate the mechanical behavior of half-sarcomeres that were connected in series with springs of varying stiffness. (The springs mimic the combined effects of half-sarcomere heterogeneity and muscle's series elastic component.) Half-sarcomeres that shortened by {\textgreater}???10 nm when they were activated subsequently relaxed with a biphasic profile; force initially declined slowly and approximately linearly before collapsing with a fast exponential time course. Stretches imposed during the linear phase quickened relaxation, while shortening movements prolonged the time course. These predictions are consistent with data from experiments performed by many other groups using single muscle fibers and isolated myofibrils. When half-sarcomeres were linked to stiff springs (so that they did not shorten appreciably during the simulations), force relaxed with a slow exponential time course and did not show biphasic behavior. Together, these results suggest that fast relaxation of striated muscle is an emergent property that reflects multiscale interactions within the muscle architecture. The nonlinear behavior during relaxation reflects perturbations to the dynamic coupling of regulated binding sites and cycling myosin heads that are induced by interfilamentary movement.},

abstract = {Fast-twitch (FT) and slow-twitch (ST) muscle fibers vary in their mechanical and energetic properties, and it has been suggested that muscle fiber type distribution influences energy expenditure and the energetically optimal cadence during pedaling. However, it is challenging to experimentally isolate the effects of muscle fiber type on pedaling energetics. In the present study, a modeling and computer simulation approach was used to test the dependence of muscle energy expenditure on pedaling rate during submaximal cycling. Simulations were generated using a musculoskeletal model at cadences from 40 to 120 rev min-1, and the dynamic and energetic properties of the model muscles were scaled to represent a range of muscle fiber types. Energy expenditure and the energetically optimal cadence were found to be higher in a model with more FT fibers than a model with more ST fibers, consistent with predictions from the experimental literature. At the muscle level, mechanical efficiency was lower in the model with a greater proportion of FT fibers, but peaked at a higher cadence than in the ST model. Regardless of fiber type distribution, mechanical efficiency was low at 40 rev min-1, increased to a broad plateau between 60 and 100 rev min-1, and decreased substantially at 120 rev min-1. In conclusion, muscle fiber type distribution was confirmed as an important determinant of the energetics of pedaling. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The relative significance of central (VE, Vo2, heart rate) or peripheral (muscle tension, muscle metabolites) factors on perceived exertion (RPE) was investigated with bicycle exercise by varying pedal rate while maintaining a constant power output. Six healthy male subjects exercised at zero load, submaximal (70{\%} Vo2max) and maximal exercise intensities with pedal rates of 40, 60, 80, and 100 rpm. With changing pedal rate and constant power output, there were numerous examples of significant changes in the central factors with no change in RPE and vice versa. Similarly, measures of muscle and blood lactate, NAD, glycogen, ATP, and CP failed to demonstrate any local metabolic factor that correlated with RPE. Force exerted on the pedals and the rate of force generation approximated RPE changes, but the detailed correlation analysis was nonsignificant. None of the central or peripheral factors alone are related to RPE. Thus, RPE must be derived from a number of peripheral and/or central factors in a complex manner.},

These studies show that changing posture has a more profound influence on neuromuscular coordination than does changing slope. Most of the changes with standing posture occur late in the downstroke: increased ankle and knee joint moment, reduced hip joint moment and greater activity in specific muscles. Due to the influence of lower extremity inertial properties, higher pedaling frequency induces more neuromuscular changes at the hip than at the knee or ankle joints. These neuromuscular adaptations to environmental and task constraints are discussed with regard to the contributions of the central nervous system and the solution provided by peripheral anatomical structure--mono- and biarticular muscles. The results indicate that training and related movement analysis should be specific to the motion, supporting the notion of task-specific training.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this experiment was to establish the reproducibility of gross efficiency (GE), delta efficiency (DE), and economy (EC) during a graded cycle ergometer test in seventeen male subjects. METHODS: All subjects performed three identical exercise tests at a constant pedal cadence of 80 rpm on an electrically braked cycle ergometer. Energy expenditure was estimated from measures of oxygen uptake (VO(2)) and carbon dioxide production (VCO(2)) by using stoichiometric equations. RESULTS: The subjects characteristics were age 24 +/- 6 yr, body mass 74.6 +/- 6.9 kg, body fat 13.9 +/- 2.2{\%}, and VO(2max) 61.9 +/- 2.4 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) (all means +/- SD). Average GE, DE, and EC for the three tests were 19.8 +/- 0.6{\%}, 25.8 +/- 1.5{\%}, and 5.0 +/- 0.1 kJ x L(-1), respectively. The coefficients of variation (confidence limits) were GE 4.2 (3.2-6.4){\%}, DE 6.7 (5.0-10.0){\%}, and EC 3.3 (2.4-4.9){\%}. GE was significantly lower at 95 W and 130 W when compared with 165 W, 200 W, 235 W, 270 W, and 305 W. GE at 165 W was significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) that GE at 235 W. A weak correlation (r = 0.491; P {\textless} 0.05) was found between peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak)) and GE, whereas no correlations were found between VO(2max) and DE or EC. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a graded exercise test with 3-min stages and 35-W increments is a method by which reproducible measurements of both GE and EC can be obtained, whereas measurements of DE seemed slightly more variable.},

abstract = {A saggital plane biomechanical analysis of 11 slow jogging trials yielded joint moments of force, power curves and positive and negative work at each of the joints of the lower limb. The following can be summarized: 1. 1. The total moment of force pattern of the lower limb was primarily extensor during stance and flexor during swing. The hip had an extensor peak at 20{\%}, the knee at 40{\%} and the ankle at 60{\%} of stance. 2. 2. The variability of the moment patterns across all trials was considerably less than that seen during natural walking. 3. 3. Two power bursts were seen at the ankle, absorption early in stance followed by a dominant generation peak during late push-off. The average peak of power generation was 800 W with individual maximums exceeding 1500 W. 4. 4. Power patterns for all trials showed the knee to have five distinct phases: an initial shock absorbing peak during weight acceptance, a small generation burst during early push-off, a major absorption pattern during late push-off continuing until maximum knee flexion, a third absorption peak decelerating the leg and foot prior to impact, and a final small positive burst as the knee flexors rotate the leg posteriorly to further reduce the forward velocity of the foot prior to heel contact. 5. 5. Power patterns at the hip were neither large nor consistent indicating the dual role of hip flexors and extensors relative to the trunk and lower limb stability. 6. 6. Positive work done by the ankle plantarflexors averaged three times that done by the knee extensors, and in some joggers the ankle muscles generated eight times that of the knee muscles. 7. 7. Over the entire stride the knee muscles absorbed 3.6 times as much energy as they generated; the ankle muscles generated 2.9 times as much as they absorbed. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Humans walk and run over a wide range of speeds with remarkable efficiency. For steady locomotion, moving at different speeds requires the muscle–tendon units of the leg to modulate the amount of mechanical power the limb absorbs and outputs in each step. How individual muscles adapt their behavior to modulate limb power output has been examined using computer simulation and animal models, but has not been studied in vivo in humans. In this study, we used a combination of ultrasound imaging and motion analysis to examine how medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle–tendon unit behavior is adjusted to meet the varying mechanical demands of different locomotor speeds during walking and running in humans. The results highlighted key differences in MG fascicle-shortening velocity with both locomotor speed and gait. Fascicle-shortening velocity at the time of peak muscle force production increased with walking speed, impairing the ability of the muscle to produce high peak forces. Switching to a running gait at 2.0 m⋅s−1 caused fascicle shortening at the time of peak force production to shift to much slower velocities. This velocity shift facilitated a large increase in peak muscle force and an increase in MG power output. MG fascicle velocity may be a key factor that limits the speeds humans choose to walk at, and may explain the transition from walking to running. This finding is consistent with previous modeling studies.},

abstract = {Introduction$\backslash$nInverse dynamics joint kinetics are often used to infer contributions$\backslash$nfrom underlying groups of muscle-tendon units (MTUs). However, such$\backslash$ninterpretations are confounded by multiarticular (multi-joint)$\backslash$nmusculature, which can cause inverse dynamics to over-or under-estimate$\backslash$nnet MTU power. Misestimation of MTU power could lead to incorrect$\backslash$nscientific conclusions, or to empirical estimates that misguide$\backslash$nmusculoskeletal simulations, assistive device designs, or clinical$\backslash$ninterventions. The objective of this study was to investigate the degree$\backslash$nto which ankle joint power overestimates net plantarflexor MTU power$\backslash$nduring the Push-off phase of walking, due to the behavior of the flexor$\backslash$ndigitorum and hallucis longus (FDHL)-multiarticular MTUs crossing the$\backslash$nankle and metatarsophalangeal (toe) joints.$\backslash$nMethods$\backslash$nWe performed a gait analysis study on six healthy participants,$\backslash$nrecording ground reaction forces, kinematics, and electromyography$\backslash$n(EMG). Empirical data were input into an EMG-driven musculoskeletal$\backslash$nmodel to estimate ankle power. This model enabled us to parse$\backslash$ncontributions from mono-and multi-articular MTUs, and required only one$\backslash$nscaling and one time delay factor for each subject and speed, which were$\backslash$nsolved for based on empirical data. Net plantarflexing MTU power was$\backslash$ncomputed by the model and quantitatively compared to inverse dynamics$\backslash$nankle power.$\backslash$nResults$\backslash$nThe EMG-driven model was able to reproduce inverse dynamics ankle power$\backslash$nacross a range of gait speeds (R-2 {\textgreater}= 0.97), while also providing$\backslash$nMTU-specific power estimates.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Computer modeling, simulation and optimization are powerful tools that have seen increased use in biomechanics research. Dynamic optimizations can be categorized as either data-tracking or predictive problems. The data-tracking approach has been used extensively to address human movement problems of clinical relevance. The predictive approach also holds great promise, but has seen limited use in clinical applications. Enhanced software tools would facilitate the application of predictive musculoskeletal simulations to clinically-relevant research. The open-source software OpenSim provides tools for generating tracking simulations but not predictive simulations. However, OpenSim includes an extensive application programming interface that permits extending its capabilities with scripting languages such as MATLAB. In the work presented here, we combine the computational tools provided by MATLAB with the musculoskeletal modeling capabilities of OpenSim to create a framework for generating predictive simulations of musculoskeletal movement based on direct collocation optimal control techniques. In many cases, the direct collocation approach can be used to solve optimal control problems considerably faster than traditional shooting methods. Cyclical and discrete movement problems were solved using a simple 1 degree of freedom musculoskeletal model and a model of the human lower limb, respectively. The problems could be solved in reasonable amounts of time (several seconds to 1–2 hours) using the open-source IPOPT solver. The problems could also be solved using the fmincon solver that is included with MATLAB, but the computation times were excessively long for all but the smallest of problems. The performance advantage for IPOPT was derived primarily by exploiting sparsity in the constraints Jacobian. The framework presented here provides a powerful and flexible approach for generating optimal control simulations of musculoskeletal movement using OpenSim and MATLAB. This should allow researchers to more readily use predictive simulation as a tool to address clinical conditions that limit human mobility.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Honeine2014,
abstract = {In the single-stance phase of gait, gravity acting on the center of mass (CoM) causes a disequilibrium torque, which generates propulsive force. Triceps surae activity resists gravity by restraining forward tibial rotation thereby tuning CoM momentum. We hypothesized that time and amplitude modulation of triceps surae activity determines the kinematics (step length and cadence) and kinetics of gait. Nineteen young subjects participated in two experiments. In the gait initiation (GI) protocol, subjects deliberately initiated walking at different velocities for the same step length. In the balance-recovery (BR) protocol, subjects executed steps of different length after being unexpectedly released from an inclined posture. Ground reaction force was recorded by a large force platform and electromyography of soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, and tibialis anterior muscles was collected by wireless surface electrodes. In both protocols, the duration of triceps activity was highly correlated with single-stance duration (GI, R (2) = 0.68; BR, R (2) = 0.91). In turn, step length was highly correlated with single-stance duration (BR, R (2) = 0.70). Control of CoM momentum was obtained by decelerating the CoM fall via modulation of amplitude of triceps activity. By modulation of triceps activity, the central nervous system (CNS) varied the position of CoM with respect to the center of pressure (CoP). The CoM-CoP gap in the sagittal plane was determinant for setting the disequilibrium torque and thus walking velocity. Thus, by controlling the gap, CNS-modified walking velocity (GI, R (2) = 0.86; BR, R (2) = 0.92). This study is the first to highlight that by merely counteracting gravity, triceps activity sets the kinematics and kinetics of gait. It also provides evidence that the surge in triceps activity during fast walking is due to the increased requirement of braking the fall of CoM in late stance in order to perform a smoother step-to-step transition.},

In the underlying model each point (whose trajectory is tracked by a marker) is a point mass: Hence the body is represented by a simple system of point masses. The first step is to determine the appropriate set of points and the mass of each point, which is assumed to be specific for the movement performed. The distribution of the mass to each marker is determined from training data for which the true (or reference) trajectories of the CoM, LM or AM are known. This leads to a quadratic optimization problem with inequality constraints. The use of the method is demonstrated on data from discus throw. Results indicate reasonably small errors, considering the magnitude of other error sources, in CoM position (average magnitude of estimation error 1-2 cm), and moderate errors in AM (13-20{\%} of peak value). ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. Human muscle endurance is apparently enhanced during maximal voluntary contractions at short muscle lengths (McKenzie {\&} Gandevia, 1987) but the ability of subjects to activate muscles fully at short lengths has not been established. Therefore this study examined the voluntary capacity to activate muscles fully at control (near resting) lengths and at decreased muscle lengths. Changes in mechanical properties of twitch responses to electrical stimulation of relaxed muscles at short muscle lengths were also documented. The abductor digiti minimi, elbow flexors and tibialis anterior were studied in five subjects. 2. For the three muscle groups, the mean reduction in twitch force between the control and short muscle lengths ranged from 46-51{\%}. At the short length there was a 9-13{\%} reduction in the contraction time and a 21-27{\%} reduction in the half-relaxation time. Maximal voluntary force declined by 21-49{\%} at the short muscle length. A reduction in muscle length produced a shift to the right of the force-frequency curve as determined by brief trains of electrical stimuli. 3. During maximal efforts single or brief trains of two to four supramaximal stimuli, delivered to the parent nerve or motor point, failed to increase the force at a latency appropriate for onset of a muscle twitch in some but not all attempts. Each subject achieved 'maximal activation' of the muscle in a similar proportion of attempts at the control and short muscle lengths. 4. These results suggest that maximal voluntary activation of motoneurone pools is possible at short muscle lengths and that the central nervous system is able to maintain the discharge of motoneurons close to 'fusion' frequency despite a decrease in the temporal characteristics of the isometric twitch.},

To lower mechanical indeterminacy in the joints the system is reduced by grouping the muscles acting in synergism. The joint torques were calculated by inverse dynamics methods from cycling motion data, including kinematics and foot/pedal reaction loads (forces, moments). The mechanical indeterminacy was resolved by applying optimization criteria and the individual muscle torques were parceled-out from the joint torques. System identification of the individual muscles, part of which being bi-articular, in this non-isometric condition was performed from the relationship between the evaluated force and the measured EMG of each the muscles, using both first and second order linear transfer functions.

The same was done for more complex, multiple-joint, one- and two-legged pedaling. These particular activities were chosen because they could be considered related to some extent, as they shared a key aspect of knee extension, and because they at the same time were different. The activities were performed at submaximal intensities, by healthy individuals (n = 16, thereof eight women; 23.4 ± 2.7 years; 1.70 ± 0.11 m; 68.6 ± 11.2 kg). High and fair correlations (R-values of 0.99 and 0.75) occurred between frequencies generated with the dominant leg and the nondominant leg during knee extension exercise and pedaling, respectively. Fair to high correlations (R-values between 0.71 and 0.95) occurred between frequencies performed with each of the two legs in an activity, and the two-legged frequency performed in the same type of activity. In general, the correlations were higher for knee extension exercise than for pedaling. Correlations between knee extension and pedaling frequencies were of modest occurrence. The correlations between movement frequencies generated separately by each of the legs might be interpreted to support the following working hypothesis, which was based on existing literature. It is likely that involved central pattern generators (CPGs) of the two legs share a common frequency generator or that separate frequency generators of each leg are attuned via interneuronal connections. Further, activity type appeared to be relevant. Thus, the apparent common rhythmogenesis for the two legs appeared to be stronger for the relatively simple single-joint activity of knee extension exercise as compared to the more complex multi-joint activity of pedaling. Finally, it appeared that the shared aspect of knee extension in the related types of activities of knee extension exercise and pedaling was insufficient to cause obvious correlations between generated movement frequencies in the two types of activities.},

abstract = {Estimation of human oxygen uptake ( {\_}Vo2) during exercise is often used as an alternative when its direct measurement is not feasible. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) suggests estimating human {\_}Vo2 during exercise on a cycle ergometer through an equation that considers individual's body mass and external work rate, but not pedaling rate (PR). We hypothesized that including PR in the ACSM equation would improve its {\_}Vo2 prediction accuracy. Ten healthy male participants' (age 19–48 years) were recruited and their steady-state {\_}Vo2 was recorded on a cycle ergometer for 16 combinations of external work rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 W) and PR (50, 70, 90, and 110 revolutions per minute). {\_}Vo2 was calculated by means of a new equation, and by the ACSM equation for comparison. Kinematic data were collected by means of an infrared 3-D motion analysis system in order to explore the mechanical determinants of {\_}Vo2. Including PR in the ACSM equation improved the accuracy for prediction of sub-maximal {\_}Vo2 during exercise (mean bias 1.9 vs. 3.3 mL O2 kg?1 min?1) but it did not affect the accuracy for prediction of maximal {\_}Vo2 (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Confirming the validity of this new equation, the results were replicated for data reported in the literature in 51 participants. We conclude that PR is an important determinant of human {\_}Vo2 during cycling exercise, and it should be considered when predicting oxygen consumption.},

Designers of HPV's often focus on how resistive forces (friction, drag) can be minimized, as opposed to how propulsive forces can be maximized. How to maximize propulsive forces through vehicle design is not often understood because of a complex interaction between internal biomechanical factors (muscle force/torque/power production) and external mechanical factors (e.g., seat-to-pedal distance, crank arm length, seat-tube angle, backrest angle, chain wheel size). The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to provide information, from a biomechanical and physiological perspective, how muscle force is produced and modified; and (2) to examine how the muscle force produced interacts with external mechanical factors to produce power.},

abstract = {The overall purpose of the present dissertation was to contribute to the understanding of voluntary human rhythmic leg movement behaviour and control. This was achieved by applying pedalling as a movement model and exposing healthy and recreationally active individuals as well as trained cyclists to for example cardiopulmonary and mechanical loading, fatiguing exercise, and heavy strength training. As a part of the background, the effect of pedalling frequency on diverse relevant biomechanical, physiological, and psychophysiological variables as well as on performance was initially explored. Freely chosen pedalling frequency is considerably higher than the energetically optimal pedalling frequency. This has been shown by others and was confirmed in the present work. As a result, pedal force is relatively low while rates of VO2 and energy turnover are relatively high during freely chosen pedalling as compared to a condition where a lower and more efficient pedalling frequency is imposed. The freely chosen pedalling frequency was in the present work, and by others, found to most likely be less advantageous than the lower energetically optimal pedalling frequency with respect to performance during intensive cycling following prolonged submaximal cycling. This stimulates the motivation to understand the behaviour and control of the freely chosen pedalling frequency during cycling. Freely chosen pedalling frequency was in the present work shown to be highly individual. In addition, the pedalling frequency was shown to be steady in a longitudinal perspective across 12 weeks. Further, it was shown to be unaffected by both fatiguing hip extension exercise and hip flexion exercise as well as by increased loading on the cardiopulmonary system at constant mechanical loading, and vice versa. Based on this, the freely chosen pedalling frequency is considered to be characterised as a highly individual, steady, and robust innate voluntary motor rhythm under primary influence of central pattern generators. The last part of the characterisation is largely based on, and supported by, work of other researchers in the field. Despite the robustness of the freely chosen pedalling frequency, it may be affected by some particular factors. As an example from the present work, freely chosen pedalling frequency during treadmill cycling increased by on average 15 to 17 rpm when power output was increased from a value corresponding to 86{\%} and up to 165{\%} of Wmax . This phenomenon is supported by other studies. As another example from the present work, freely chosen pedalling frequency decreased by on average 9 to 14 rpm following heavy strength training that involved both hip extension and hip flexion. Further, the present work suggested that the latter phenomenon occurred within the first week of training and was caused by in particular the hip extension strength training rather than the hip flexion strength training. The fast response to the strength training indicated that neural adaptations presumably caused the observed changes in movement behaviour. The internal organisation of the central pattern generator is by some other researchers in the field considered to be functionally separated into two components, in which, one is responsible for movement frequency and another is responsible for movement pattern. For the present dissertation, the freely chosen pedalling frequency was considered to reflect the rhythmic movement frequency of the voluntary rhythmic leg movement of pedalling. The tangential pedal force profile was considered to reflect the rhythmic movement pattern. The present work showed that fatiguing hip flexion exercise in healthy and recreationally active individuals modified the tangential pedal force profile during cycling at a pre-set target pedalling frequency in a way that the minimum tangential pedal force became more negative, the maximum tangential pedal force increased, and the phase with negative tangential pedal force increased. In other words, the legs were "actively lifted" to a lesser extent in the upstroke phase. Fatiguing hip extension exercise did not have that effect. And none of the fatiguing exercises affected the freely chosen pedalling frequency. The present work furthermore showed that the primary effect of hip extension strength training was that it decreased the freely chosen pedalling frequency. An interpretation of this could be that the hip extension strength training, in particular, influenced the output from the component of the central pattern generator that may be responsible for rhythmic movement frequency.},

Whole-body gross efficiency decreased from 20-22{\%} at 61 r.p.m. to 15-18{\%} at 115 r.p.m. Mean muscular efficiency for all subjects (n=16) was approximately 26{\%}, with delta efficiency being constant and muscular efficiency (taking internal power into account) slightly increasing with pedal rate. Muscular efficiency correlated positively (R(2)=0.25) with {\%} ST fibers (21-97{\%} ST in m. vastus lateralis) at 115 r.p.m. while not at 61 and 88 r.p.m. In conclusion, the decrease in whole-body gross efficiency with increasing pedal rate was not explained by a decrease in muscular efficiency, and supported increase in internal power to account for the increase in metabolic power with increasing pedal rate. Furthermore, differences between individuals in muscle fiber type composition affected muscular efficiency, which correlated positively with {\%} ST muscle fibers during fast pedalling.},

abstract = {Problems of posture in cycling are closely related to a badly adjusted saddle. Many of these problems can be prevented if the bicycle is correctly adjusted. In the search for an optimum posture of the cyclist, a balance should be found to both prevent injuries and enhance performance. If the influence of bicycle 'posture height' on generation of muscular power is largely investigated, little attention is carried out about the effects of 'posture length' on the cyclist neuromuscular strategy. The purpose of the present study is to compare joint powers for different configurations of the cyclist 'posture length'. Fourteen competitive cyclists and triathletes (28.2 ?? 7.5 years) perform 3-min trials on a stationary cycloergometer at four different 'posture lengths' (preferred, backward, intermediate, forward) each separated by one minute of rest. The cyclists exercise an external power of 3.8 ?? 0.1 W.kg-1 and pedaling cadence is controlled at 90 ?? 5 rpm for all trials. Three-dimensional external forces and moments were measured at each pedal using six components force sensors. Using pedal forces and lower limb three-dimensional kinematics, joint powers are calculated at the ankle, knee and hip joints using an inverse dynamics procedure and normalized to the subject body mass. The results of pedal and joint powers output show that preferred and forward posture lead to develop larger knee power than backward posture. The latter requires to develop supplementary joint power at the hips that compensate joint power deficiency at the knees. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although constant-average-velocity walking has been extensively studied, less is known about walking maneuvers that change speed. We investigated the function of individual leg joints when humans walked at a constant speed, accelerated or decelerated. We hypothesized that leg joints make different functional contributions to maneuvers. Specifically, we hypothesized that the hip generates positive mechanical work (acting like a "motor"), the knee generates little mechanical work (acting like a "strut"), and the ankle absorbs energy during the first half of stance and generates energy during the second half (consistent with "spring"-like function). We recorded full body kinematics and kinetics, used inverse dynamics to estimate net joint moments, and decomposed joint function into strut-motor-damper-and spring-like components using indices based on net joint work. Although overall leg mechanics were primarily strut-like, individual joints did not act as struts during stance. The hip functioned as a power generating "motor," and ankle function was consistent with spring-like behavior. Even though net knee work was small, the knee did not behave solely as a strut but also showed motor-and damper-like function. Acceleration involved increased motor-like function of the hip and ankle. Deceleration involved decreased hip motor-like function and ankle spring-like function and increased damping at the knee and ankle. Changes to joint mechanical work were primarily due to changes in joint angular displacements and not net moments. Overall, joints maintain different functional roles during unsteady locomotion.},

abstract = {This target article addresses the role of storage and reutilization of elastic energy in stretch-shortening cycles. It is argued that for discrete movements such as the vertical jump, elastic energy does not explain the work enhancement due to the prestretch. This enhancement seems to occur because the prestretch allows muscles to develop a high level of active state and force before starting to shorten. For cyclic movements in which stretch-shortening cycles occur repetitively, some authors have claimed that elastic energy enhances mechanical efficiency. In the current article it is demonstrated that this claim is often based on disputable concepts such as the efficiency of positive work or absolute work, and it is argued that elastic energy cannot affect mechanical efficiency simply because this energy is not related to the conversion of metabolic energy into mechanical energy. A comparison of work and efficiency measures obtained at different levels of organization reveals that there is in fact no decisive evidence to either support or reject the claim that the stretch-shortening cycle enhances muscle efficiency. These explorations lead to the conclusion that the body of knowledge about the mechanics and energetics of the stretch-shortening cycle is in fact quite lean. A major challenge is to bridge the gap between knowledge obtained at different levels of organization, with the ultimate purpose of understanding how the intrinsic properties of muscles manifest themselves under in-vivo-like conditions and how they are exploited in whole-body activities such as running. To achieve this purpose, a close cooperation is required between muscle physiologists and human movement scientists performing inverse and forward dynamic simulation studies of whole-body exercises.

Nine cyclists completed two different evaluations of their lower limbs maximum joint torques. Maximum Isolated Torques were assessed on isolated joint movements using an isokinetic ergometer and Maximum Pedalling Torques were calculated at the ankle, knee and hip for flexion and extension by inverse dynamics during cycling at maximum power. A correlation analysis was made between each Maximum Isolated Torques and the respective Maximum Pedalling Torques [3 joints x (flexion + extension)], showing no significant relationship. Only one significant relationship was found between cycling maximum power and knee extension Maximum Isolated Torques (r=0.68, P{\textless}0.05). Lacks of correlations between isolated joint torques measured at slow angular velocity and the same joint torques involved in a polyarticular task show that transfers between both are not direct due to differences in joint angular velocities and in mono-articular versus poly articular joint torque production capabilities. However, this study confirms that maximum power in cycling is correlated with slow angular velocity mono-articular maximum knee extension torque.},

abstract = {Analyses of joint moments are important in the study of human motion, and are crucial for our understanding of e.g. how and why ACL injuries occur. Such analyses may be affected by artifacts due to inconsistencies in the equations of motion when force and movement data are filtered with different cut-off frequencies. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of these artifacts, and compare joint moments calculated with the same or different cut-off frequency for the filtering of force and movement data. 123 elite handball players performed sidestep cutting while the movement was recorded by eight 240. Hz cameras and the ground reaction forces were recorded by a 960. Hz force plate. Knee and hip joint moments were calculated through inverse dynamics, with four different combinations of cut-off frequencies for signal filtering: movement 10. Hz, force 10. Hz, (10-10); movement 15. Hz, force 15. Hz; movement 10. Hz, force 50. Hz (10-50); movement 15. Hz, force 50. Hz. The results revealed significant differences, especially between conditions with different filtering of force and movement. Mean (SD) peak knee abduction moment for the 10-10 and 10-50 condition were 1.27 (0.53) and 1.64 (0.68) Nm/kg, respectively. Ranking of players based on knee abduction moments were affected by filtering condition. Out of 20 players with peak knee abduction moment higher than mean+1. SD with the 10-50 condition, only 11 were still above mean+1. SD when the 10-10 condition was applied. Hip moments were very sensitive to filtering cut-off. Mean (SD) peak hip flexion moment was 3.64 (0.75) and 5.92 (1.80) under the 10-10 and 10-50 conditions, respectively. Based on these findings, force and movement data should be processed with the same filter. Conclusions from previous inverse dynamics studies, where this was not the case, should be treated with caution. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In riding, most biomechanical studies have focused on the description of the horse locomotion in unridden condition. In this study, we draw the prospect of how the basic principles established in inter-personal coordination by the theory of Coordination Dynamics may provide a conceptual and methodological framework for understanding the horse-rider coupling. The recent development of mobile technologies allows combined horse and rider recordings during long lasting natural events such as endurance races. Six international horse-rider dyads were thus recorded during a 120 km race by using two tri-axial accelerometers placed on the horses and riders, respectively. The analysis concentrated on their combined vertical displacements. The obtained shapes and angles of Lissajous plots together with values of relative phase between horse and rider displacements at lower reversal point allowed us to characterize four coordination patterns, reflecting the use of two riding techniques per horse's gait (trot and canter). The present study shows that the concepts, methods and tools of self-organizing dynamic system approach offer new directions for understanding horse-rider coordination. The identification of the horse-rider coupling patterns constitutes a firm basis to further study the coalition of multiple constraints that determine their emergence and their dynamics in endurance race.},

abstract = {Elastic energy returned from passive-elastic structures of the lower limb is fundamental in lowering the mechanical demand on muscles during running. The purpose of this study was to investigate the two length-modulating mechanisms of the plantar fascia, namely medial longitudinal arch compression and metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) excursion, and to determine how these mechanisms modulate strain, and thus elastic energy storage/return of the plantar fascia during running. Eighteen runners (9 forefoot and 9 rearfoot strike) performed three treadmill running trials; unrestricted shod, shod with restricted arch compression (via an orthotic-style insert), and barefoot. Three-dimensional motion capture and ground reaction force data were used to calculate lower limb kinematics and kinetics including MPJ angles, moments, powers and work. Estimates of plantar fascia strain due to arch compression and MPJ excursion were derived using a geometric model of the arch and a subject-specific musculoskeletal model of the plantar fascia, respectively. The plantar fascia exhibited a typical elastic stretch-shortening cycle with the majority of strain generated via arch compression. This strategy was similar in fore- and rear-foot strike runners. Restricting arch compression, and hence the elastic-spring function of the arch, was not compensated for by an increase in MPJ-derived strain. In the second half of stance the plantar fascia was found to transfer energy between the MPJ (energy absorption) and the arch (energy production during recoil). This previously unreported energy transfer mechanism reduces the strain required by the plantar fascia in generating useful positive mechanical work at the arch during running.},

The mechanical power spent to accelerate the limbs relative to the trunk in level walking and running, lint, has been measured at various 'constant' speeds (3-33 km/hr) with the cinematographic procedure used by Fenn (1930a) at high speeds of running. 2. Wint increases approximately as the square of the speed of walking and running. For a given speed JWint is greater in walking than in running. 3. In walking above 3 km/hr, Jint is greater than the power spent to accelerate and lift the centre of mass of the body at each step, text (measured by Cavagna, Thys {\&} Zamboni, 1976b). In running Jint {\textless} Wext up to about 20 km/hr, whereas at higher speeds Jint {\textgreater} Wext. 4. The total work done by the muscles was calculated as Wtot = I Wint I + I Wext I Except that at the highest speeds of walking, the total work done per unit distance Wtot/km is greater in running than in walking. 5. The efficiency of positive work was measured from the ratio Wtot/Net energy expenditure: this is greater than 0-25 indicating that both in walking and in running the muscles utilize, during shortening, some energy stored during a previous phase of negative work (stretching). 6. In walking the efficiency reaches a maximum (0.35-0.40) at inter-mediate speeds, as may be expected from the properties of the contractile component of muscle. In running the efficiency increases steadily with speed (from 0 45 to 0.70-0.80) suggesting that positive work derives mainly from the passive recoil of muscle elastic elements and to a lesser extent},

Aim of the present study was to test whether a higher RPM reduces the fraction ({\%}) of the {\textperiodcentered} VO2 used for carbohydrate oxidation (relCHO) at a given BLC. Eight males (23.9 ± 1.6 yrs; 177 ± 3 cm; 70.3 ± 3.4 kg) performed incremental load tests at 50 and 100 RPM. BLC, {\textperiodcentered} VO2 and {\textperiodcentered} VCO2 were measured. At respiratory exchange ratios (RER) {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 1, relCHO were calculated and the constant determining 50 {\%} relCHO (kCHO) was approximated as a function of the BLC. At submaximal workload {\textperiodcentered} VO2, {\textperiodcentered} VCO2, and relCHO were lower (all p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.002; $\eta$² {\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}} 0.209) at 50 than at 100 RPM. No differences were observed in {\textperiodcentered} VO2peak (3.96 ± 0.22 vs. 4.00 ± 0.25 l{\textperiodcentered}min-1) and RERpeak (1.18 ± 0.02 vs. 1.15 ± 0.02). BLC was lower (p {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.001; $\eta$² = 0.680) at 50 than at 100 RPM irrespective of cycling intensity. At 50 RPM, kCHO (4.2 ± 1.4 (mmol {\textperiodcentered} l -1) 3 ) was lower (p = 0.043; $\eta$² = 0.466) than at 100 RPM (5.9 ± 1.9 (mmol {\textperiodcentered}l -1) 3 ). This difference in kCHO reflects a reduced CHO oxidation at a given BLC at 100 than at 50 RPM. At a low exercise intensity, a higher cycling cadence can substantially reduce the reliance on CHO at a given metabolic rate and/or BLC. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {Humans, birds and (occasionally) apes walk bipedally. Humans, birds, many lizards and (at their highest speeds) cockroaches run bipedally. Kangaroos, some rodents and many birds hop bipedally, and jerboas and crows use a skipping gait. This paper deals only with walking and running bipeds. Chimpanzees walk with their knees bent and their backs sloping forward. Most birds walk and run with their backs and femurs sloping at small angles to the horizontal, and with their knees bent. These differences from humans make meaningful comparisons of stride length, duty factor, etc., difficult, even with the aid of dimensionless parameters that would take account of size differences, if dynamic similarity were preserved. Lizards and cockroaches use wide trackways. Humans exert a two-peaked pattern of force on the ground when walking, and an essentially single-peaked pattern when running. The patterns of force exerted by apes and birds are never as markedly two-peaked as in fast human walking. Comparisons with quadrupedal mammals of the same body mass show that human walking is relatively economical of metabolic energy, and human running is expensive. Bipedal locomotion is remarkably economical for wading birds, and expensive for geese and penguins.},

Methods Sixteen healthy men participated in the study. An incremental exercise test involving pedaling a cycling ergometer at 50 rpm was conducted to assess maximal oxy-gen consumption and WorkLT. The participants performed constant workload, submaximal exercise tests at WorkLT intensity with three different pedaling rates (35, 50, and 75 rpm). Oxygen consumption (˙ intensity with three different pedaling rates (35, 50, and 75 rpm). Oxygen consumption (˙ VO2), (˙ VO2), blood pressure, heart rate (HR), blood lactate, and pedal force were measured and oxy-hemoglobin/myoglobin concentration (OxyHb/ Mb) at vastus lateralis was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy during exercise. The participants were then randomly assigned to cycling exercise training at WorkLT in either the low or high frequency pedaling rate (LFTr, 35 rpm or HFTr, 75 rpm) group. Each 60-min training ses-sion was performed five times/week. Results Despite maintaining the same sion was performed five times/week. Results Despite maintaining the same work rate, ˙ VO2 ˙ VO2 and HR were significantly lower at 35 than 75 rpm. Conversely, integrated pedal force was significantly higher at 35 than 75 rpm. Peripheral OxyHb/Mb was significantly lower at 35 than 75 rpm. After 2 weeks of training, WorkLT normal-ized to body mass significantly increased in the LFTr, but not the HFTr group.

abstract = {The mechanical power for cycling (P(c)) at constant ground speed (s), in the absence of wind on smooth hard terrain is the sum of the power dissipated against rolling resistance, gravity and air resistance: P(c)=a x s + M x g x s x sin gamma + b x S3, where a and b are constants, M is the mass of the subject plus bike, g is the acceleration of gravity and gamma is the angle of the terrain with the horizontal. The constant b depends upon the drag coefficient (Cd), the overall area projected on the frontal plane (A(f)), and the air density (rhoa): b = 0.5 x C(d) x A(f) x rhoa. In turn, rhoa depends on air pressure (P(B)) and temperature (T): rhoa=rho0 x 0.359 x P(B) x T(-1), where rho0 is the air density at 760 mmHg (101.3 kPa) and 273 K. The metabolic power developed by the cyclist (E(c)) is related to P(c) E(c) = P(c) x eta(-1), where eta is the mechanical efficiency of cycling. The experimental values of a, b and eta are fairly well known so that, if the maximal metabolic power as a function of the performance time is known for a given cyclist, the following set of data can be individually calculated: (1) best performances over any given distance and for any given altitude above sea level, (2) the effects of posture and body size on maximal speeds, and (3) the maximal incline of the terrain that can be overcome at any given speed or coasting speed for any given downslope. The above set of information makes it possible also to calculate the characteristics of a "Twin Bikes System" (TBS) for preventing microgravity deconditioning during long-term space flight. The TBS consists of two bicycles that are mechanically coupled by a differential gearing, which move at the very same speed, but in the opposite sense, along the inner wall of a cylindrically shaped space module. The circular trajectories induce a centrifugal acceleration vector (a(c)) oriented along the head-to-feet direction of each subject: a(c) = v(t)2 x r(-1) where v(t) is the tangential velocity and r the radius of gyration, which is equal to the inner radius of the space module. So, any desired value of a(c) can be achieved by appropriately selecting v(t), wherefrom the mechanical and metabolic powers that the astronauts must generate can be readily calculated. Experiments performed in a ground-based human centrifuge have shown that the discomfort derived from the rotating environment is reasonably low and well tolerated. If the appropriate atmospheric pressure is provided, cycling on circular or elliptical tracks may be useful to reduce cardiovascular deconditioning that occurs due to the reduced gravity in permanently manned lunar bases. Indeed, on the curved parts of the path a cyclist will generate a horizontal outward acceleration: a(c) = s2 x r(-1), where s is the velocity along the track and r is the radius of curvature. To counterbalance a(c), the subject plus bike must lean inwards so that the vectorial sum of a(c) plus the lunar gravity (g(L) = 1.62 m x s(-2)) is applied along a straight line that includes the centre of mass of the system and the point of wheel contact with the ground. For values of s from 10 to 20 m x s(-1) and r from 50 to 200 m, this vectorial sum ranges from 1.05 to 5.03 g(L) (0.17-0.83 g).},

abstract = {Mechanical behavior of skeletal muscles is commonly modeled under the assumption of mechanical independence between individual muscles within a muscle group. Epimuscular myofascial force transmission via the connective tissue network surrounding a muscle challenges this assumption as it alters the force distributed to the tendons of individual muscles. This study aimed to derive a lumped estimate of stiffness of the intermuscular and extramuscular connective tissues and to assess changes in such stiffness in response to a manipulation of the interface between adjacent muscles. Based on in situ measurements of force transmission in the rat plantar flexors, before and after resection of their connective tissue network, a nonlinear estimate of epimuscular myofascial stiffness was quantified and included in a multi-muscle model with lumped parameters which allows for force transmission depending on the relative position between the muscles in the group. Such stiffness estimate was assessed for a group with normal intermuscular connective tissues and for a group with increased connectivity, mimicking scar tissue development. The model was able to successfully predict the amount of epimuscular force transmission for different experimental conditions than those used to obtain the model parameters. The proposed nonlinear stiffness estimates of epimuscular pathways could be integrated in larger musculoskeletal models, to provide more accurate predictions of force when effects of mechanical interaction or altered epimuscular connections, e.g. after surgery or injury, are substantial.},

abstract = {In maximal sprint cycling, the power-cadence relationship to assess the maximal power output (P (max)) and the corresponding optimal cadence (C (opt)) has been widely investigated in experimental studies. These studies have generally reported a quadratic power-cadence relationship passing through the origin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate an equivalent method to assess P (max) and C (opt) for endurance cycling. The two main hypotheses were: (1) in the range of cadences normally used by cyclists, the power-cadence relationship can be well fitted with a quadratic regression constrained to pass through the origin; (2) P (max) and C (opt) can be well estimated using this quadratic fit. We tested our hypothesis using a theoretical and an experimental approach. The power-cadence relationship simulated with the theoretical model was well fitted with a quadratic regression and the bias of the estimated P (max) and C (opt) was negligible (1.0 W and 0.6 rpm). In the experimental part, eight cyclists performed an incremental cycling test at 70, 80, 90, 100, and 110 rpm to yield power-cadence relationships at fixed blood lactate concentrations of 3, 3.5, and 4 mmol L(-1). The determined power outputs were well fitted with quadratic regressions (R (2) = 0.94-0.96, residual standard deviation = 1.7{\%}). The 95{\%} confidence interval for assessing individual P (max) and C (opt) was ±4.4 W and ±2.9 rpm. These theoretical and experimental results suggest that P (max), C (opt), and the power-cadence relationship around C (opt) could be well estimated with the proposed method.},

abstract = {Computational modeling and simulation of neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) systems enables researchers and clinicians to study the complex dynamics underlying human and animal movement. NMS models use equations derived from physical laws and biology to help solve challenging real-world problems, from designing prosthetics that maximize running speed to developing exoskeletal devices that enable walking after a stroke. NMS modeling and simulation has proliferated in the biomechanics research community over the past 25 years, but the lack of verification and validation standards remains a major barrier to wider adoption and impact. The goal of this paper is to establish practical guidelines for verification and validation of NMS models and simulations that researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and others can adopt to evaluate the accuracy and credibility of modeling studies. In particular, we review a general process for verification and validation applied to NMS models and simulations, including careful formulation of a research question and methods, traditional verification and validation steps, and documentation and sharing of results for use and testing by other researchers. Modeling the NMS system and simulating its motion involves methods to represent neural control, musculoskeletal geometry, muscle–tendon dynamics, contact forces, and multibody dynamics. For each of these components, we review modeling choices and software verification guidelines; discuss variability, errors, uncertainty, and sensitivity relationships; and provide recommenda- tions for verification and validation by comparing experimental data and testing robust- ness. We present a series of case studies to illustrate key principles. In closing, we discuss challenges the community must overcome to ensure that modeling and simulation are successfully used to solve the broad spectrum of problems that limit human mobility.},

abstract = {In maximal sprint cycling, the power-cadence relationship to assess the maximal power output (P (max)) and the corresponding optimal cadence (C (opt)) has been widely investigated in experimental studies. These studies have generally reported a quadratic power-cadence relationship passing through the origin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate an equivalent method to assess P (max) and C (opt) for endurance cycling. The two main hypotheses were: (1) in the range of cadences normally used by cyclists, the power-cadence relationship can be well fitted with a quadratic regression constrained to pass through the origin; (2) P (max) and C (opt) can be well estimated using this quadratic fit. We tested our hypothesis using a theoretical and an experimental approach. The power-cadence relationship simulated with the theoretical model was well fitted with a quadratic regression and the bias of the estimated P (max) and C (opt) was negligible (1.0 W and 0.6 rpm). In the experimental part, eight cyclists performed an incremental cycling test at 70, 80, 90, 100, and 110 rpm to yield power-cadence relationships at fixed blood lactate concentrations of 3, 3.5, and 4 mmol L(-1). The determined power outputs were well fitted with quadratic regressions (R (2) = 0.94-0.96, residual standard deviation = 1.7{\%}). The 95{\%} confidence interval for assessing individual P (max) and C (opt) was ±4.4 W and ±2.9 rpm. These theoretical and experimental results suggest that P (max), C (opt), and the power-cadence relationship around C (opt) could be well estimated with the proposed method.},

abstract = {Fatigue induced via a maximal isometric contraction of a single limb muscle group can evoke a "cross-over" of fatigue that reduces voluntary muscle activation and maximum isometric force in the rested contralateral homologous muscle group. We asked whether a cross-over of fatigue also occurs when fatigue is induced via high-intensity endurance exercise involving a substantial muscle mass. Specifically, we used high-intensity single-leg cycling to induce fatigue and evaluated associated effects on maximum cycling power (P (max)) in the fatigued ipsilateral leg (FAT(leg)) as well as the rested contralateral leg (REST(leg)). On separate days, 12 trained cyclists performed right leg P (max) trials before and again 30 s, 3, 5, and 10 min after a cycling time trial (TT, 10 min) performed either with their right or left leg. Fatigue was estimated by comparing exercise-induced changes in P (max) and maximum handgrip isometric force (F (max)). Mean power produced during the right and left leg TTs did not differ (203 ± 8 vs. 199 ± 8 W). Compared to pre-TT, FAT(leg) P (max) was reduced by 22 ± 3 {\%} at 30 s post-TT and remained reduced by 9 ± 2 {\%} at 5 min post-TT (both P {\textless} 0.05). Despite considerable power loss in the FAT(leg), post-TT REST(leg) P (max) (596-603 W) did not differ from pre-TT values (596 ± 35 W). There were no alterations in handgrip F (max) (529-547 N). Our data suggest that any potential cross-over of fatigue, if present at all, was not sufficient to measurably compromise REST(leg) P (max) in trained cyclists. These results along with the lack of changes in handgrip F (max) indicate that impairments in maximal voluntary neuromuscular function were specific to working muscles.},

abstract = {1. Integrated electromyogram (e.m.g.) from the vastus lateralis muscles, and steady-state rates of oxygen uptake, were measured simultaneously during the performance of set rates of positive (concentric) and negative (eccentric) work at 50 rev/min on a motorized bicycle ergometer. 2. Similar experiments were also carried out at other pedalling rates and using other leg muscles. 3. The relationships between each of the variables (integrated e.m.g., oxygen consumption) and mean torque on pedals were found to be linear (r greater than 0-98) with a remarkable degree of reproducibility in surface e.m.g. for each subject over several months. 4. The ratio of the e.m.g. slopes at 50 rev/min (positive/negative) was 1-96 +/- 0-12 while the same ratio for the oxygen uptake slopes was 6-34 +/- 0-82. The discrepancy between the ratios suggests that not only is less muscle fibre activity required to maintain the same exerted force during negative work exercise, but there is also a substantial reduction in the oxygen uptake when the fibres are stretched. This was observed for all speeds of pedalling.},

abstract = {Muscle-driven simulations of human and animal motion are widely used to complement physical experiments for studying movement dynamics. Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2-54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6-31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9{\%}, 8.9{\%}, and 20.9{\%} of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2{\%}, 16.4{\%}, and 18.5{\%}, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in OpenSim version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics.},

abstract = {This review presents information that is useful to athletes, coaches and exercise scientists in the adoption of exercise protocols, prescription of training regimens and creation of research designs. Part 2 focuses on the factors that affect cycling performance. Among those factors, aerodynamic resistance is the major resistance force the racing cyclist must overcome. This challenge can be dealt with through equipment technological modifications and body position configuration adjustments. To successfully achieve efficient transfer of power from the body to the drive train of the bicycle the major concern is bicycle configuration and cycling body position. Peak power output appears to be highly correlated with cycling success. Likewise, gear ratio and pedalling cadence directly influence cycling economy/efficiency. Knowledge of muscle recruitment throughout the crank cycle has important implications for training and body position adjustments while climbing. A review of pacing models suggests that while there appears to be some evidence in favour of one technique over another, there remains the need for further field research to validate the findings. Nevertheless, performance modelling has important implications for the establishment of performance standards and consequent recommendations for training.},

@article{Bini2011a,
abstract = {While the industrialized world adopts a largely sedentary lifestyle, ultra-marathon running races have become increasingly popular in the last few years in many countries. The ability to run long distances is also considered to have played a role in human evolution. This makes the issue of ultra-long distance physiology important. In the ability to run multiples of 10 km (up to 1000 km in one stage), fatigue resistance is critical. Fatigue is generally defined as strength loss (i.e. a decrease in maximal voluntary contraction MVC), which is known to be dependent on the type of exercise. Critical task variables include the intensity and duration of the activity, both of which are very specific to ultra-endurance sports. They also include the muscle groups involved and the type of muscle contraction, two variables that depend on the sport under consideration. The first part of this article focuses on the central and peripheral causes of the alterations to neuromuscular function that occur in ultra-marathon running. Neuromuscular function evaluation requires measurements of MVCs and maximal electrical/magnetic stimulations; these provide an insight into the factors in the CNS and the muscles implicated in fatigue. However, such measurements do not necessarily predict how muscle function may influence ultra-endurance running and whether this has an effect on speed regulation during a real competition (i.e. when pacing strategies are involved). In other words, the nature of the relationship between fatigue as measured using maximal contractions/stimulation and submaximal performance limitation/regulation is questionable. To investigate this issue, we are suggesting a holistic model in the second part of this article. This model can be applied to all endurance activities, but is specifically adapted to ultra-endurance running: the flush model. This model has the following four components: (i) the ball-cock (or buoy), which can be compared with the rate of perceived exertion, and can increase or decrease based on (ii) the filling rate and (iii) the water evacuated through the waste pipe, and (iv) a security reserve that allows the subject to prevent physiological damage. We are suggesting that central regulation is not only based on afferent signals arising from the muscles and peripheral organs, but is also dependent on peripheral fatigue and spinal/supraspinal inhibition (or disfacilitation) since these alterations imply a higher central drive for a given power output. This holistic model also explains how environmental conditions, sleep deprivation/mental fatigue, pain-killers or psychostimulants, cognitive or nutritional strategies may affect ultra-running performance.},

abstract = {Development of robotic exoskeletons to assist/enhance human locomotor performance involves lengthy prototyping, testing, and analysis. This process is further convoluted by variability in limb/body morphology and preferred gait patterns between individuals. In an attempt to expedite this process, and establish a physiological basis for actuator prescription, we developed a simple, predictive model of human neuromechanical adaptation to a passive elastic exoskeleton applied at the ankle joint during a functional task. We modeled the human triceps surae-Achilles tendon muscle tendon unit (MTU) as a single Hill-type muscle, or contractile element (CE), and series tendon, or series elastic element (SEE). This modeled system was placed under gravitational load and underwent cyclic stimulation at a regular frequency (i.e. hopping) with and without exoskeleton (Exo) assistance. We explored the effect that both Exo stiffness [Formula: see text] and muscle activation [Formula: see text] had on combined MTU and Exo (MTU + Exo), MTU, and CE/SEE mechanics and energetics. Model accuracy was verified via qualitative and quantitative comparisons between modeled and prior experimental outcomes. We demonstrated that reduced [Formula: see text] can be traded for increased [Formula: see text] to maintain consistent MTU + Exo mechanics (i.e. average positive power [Formula: see text] output) from an unassisted condition (i.e. [Formula: see text]). For these regions of parameter space, our model predicted a reduction in MTU force, SEE energy cycling, and metabolic rate [Formula: see text], as well as constant CE [Formula: see text] output compared to unassisted conditions. This agreed with previous experimental observations, demonstrating our model's predictive ability. Model predictions also provided insight into mechanisms of metabolic cost minimization, and/or enhanced mechanical performance, and we concluded that both of these outcomes cannot be achieved simultaneously, and that one must come at the detriment of the other in a spring-assisted compliant MTU.},

abstract = {Humans naturally select a cadence that minimizes metabolic cost at a constant walking velocity. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of cadence on the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle and tendon interaction, and examine how this might influence lower limb energetics. We hypothesized that cadences higher than preferred would increase MG fascicle shortening velocity because of the reduced stride time. Furthermore, we hypothesized that cadences lower than preferred would require greater MG fascicle shortening to achieve increased muscle work requirements. We measured lower limb kinematics and kinetics, surface electromyography of the triceps surae and MG fascicle length, via ultrasonography, during walking at a constant velocity at the participants' preferred cadence and offsets of ±10{\%}, ±20{\%}, and ±30{\%}. There was a significant increase in MG fascicle shortening with decreased cadence. However, there was no increase in the MG fascicle shortening velocity at cadences higher than preferred. Cumulative MG muscle activation per minute was significantly increased at higher cadences. We conclude that low cadence walking requires more MG shortening work, while MG muscle and tendon function changes little for each stride at higher cadences, driving up cumulative activation costs due to the increase in steps per minute.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of cycle crank length on maximum cycling power, optimal pedaling rate, and optimal pedal speed, and to determine the optimal crank length to leg length ratio for maximal power production. Trained cyclists (n = 16) performed maximal inertial load cycle ergometry using crank lengths of 120, 145, 170, 195, and 220 mm. Maximum power ranged from a low of 1149 (20) W for the 220-mm cranks to a high of 1194 (21) W for the 145-mm cranks. Power produced with the 145- and 170-mm cranks was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) greater than that produced with the 120- and 220-mm cranks. The optimal pedaling rate decreased significantly with increasing crank length, from 136 rpm for the 120-mm cranks to 110 rpm for the 220-mm cranks. Conversely, optimal pedal speed increased significantly with increasing crank length, from 1.71 m/s for the 120-mm cranks to 2.53 m/s for the 220-mm cranks. The crank length to leg length and crank length to tibia length ratios accounted for 20.5{\%} and 21.1{\%} of the variability in maximum power, respectively. The optimal crank length was 20{\%} of leg length or 41{\%} of tibia length. These data suggest that pedal speed (which constrains muscle shortening velocity) and pedaling rate (which affects muscle excitation state) exert distinct effects that influence muscular power during cycling. Even though maximum cycling power was significantly affected by crank length, use of the standard 170-mm length cranks should not substantially compromise maximum power in most adults.},

abstract = {The cadence that maximises power output developed at the crank by an individual cyclist is conventionally determined using a laboratory test. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (i) to show that such a cadence, which we call the optimal cadence, can be determined using power output, heart-rate, and cadence measured in the field and (ii) to describe methodology to do so. For an individual cyclist's sessions, power output is related to cadence and the elicited heart-rate using a non-linear regression model. Optimal cadences are found for two riders (83 and 70 revolutions per minute, respectively); these cadences are similar to the riders' preferred cadences (82–92 rpm and 65–75 rpm). Power output reduces by approximately 6{\%} for cadences 20 rpm above or below optimum. Our methodology can be used by a rider to determine an optimal cadence without laboratory testing intervention: the rider will need to collect power output, heart-rate, and cadence measurements from training and racing sessions over an extended period ({\textgreater}6 months); ride at a range of cadences within those sessions; and calculate his/ her optimal cadence using the methodology described or a software tool that implements it.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to establish the link between the saddle vertical force and its determinants in order to establish the strategies that could trigger the sit-stand transition. We hypothesized that the minimum saddle vertical force would be a critical parameter influencing the sit-stand transition during cycling. Twenty-five non-cyclists were asked to pedal at six different power outputs from 20{\%} (1.6??0.3Wkg-1) to 120{\%} (9.6??1.6Wkg-1) of their spontaneous sit-stand transition power obtained at 90rpm. Five 6-component sensors (saddle tube, pedals and handlebars) and a full-body kinematic reconstruction were used to provide the saddle vertical force and other force components (trunk inertial force, hips and shoulders reaction forces, and trunk weight) linked to the saddle vertical force. Minimum saddle vertical force linearly decreased with power output by 87{\%} from a static position on the bicycle (5.30??0.50Nkg-1) to power output=120{\%} of the sit-stand transition power (0.68??0.49Nkg-1). This decrease was mainly explained by the increase in instantaneous pedal forces from 2.84??0.58Nkg-1 to 6.57??1.02Nkg-1 from 20{\%} to 120{\%} of the power output corresponding to the sit-stand transition, causing an increase in hip vertical forces from -0.17Nkg-1 to 3.29Nkg-1. The emergence of strategies aiming at counteracting the elevation of the trunk (handlebars and pedals pulling) coincided with the spontaneous sit-stand transition power. The present data suggest that the large decrease in minimum saddle vertical force observed at high pedal reaction forces might trigger the sit-stand transition in cycling.},

abstract = {High intensity leg cycle ergometry is a widely used method of measuring muscular performance during maximal exercise. Until recently, it was deemed to be a predominantly lower body activity; however, there is now evidence to suggest that the upper body could be making a significant contribution to power output, as demonstrated by the intense electrical activity of the forearm musculature. As high intensity cycle ergometry often is used to measure performance in untrained cyclists it is important they are given at least two familiarisation trials to ensure results are both reliable and reproducible. In addition, diurnal variations exist during a single high intensity bout of exercise. It is likely these daily fluctuations are influenced by a number of biochemical and physiological variables. The purpose of this article is to outline factors that contribute to our interpretation of data following high intensity cycle ergometry.},

@article{Whipp1969,
abstract = {s paper discusses the theoretical, thermodynamic basis for ex- ercise efficiency and describes a modification of the method used to calculate efficiency. Eight healthy male subjects were studied during steady-state cycle ergometer work. If the net 02 cost of performing work is obtained by subtracting resting voz, as is usually done, the work efficiency calculated from the calorific value for 02 equals 20{\%}. However, if the 02 cost of “unloaded” cycling is subtracted from the steady-state work 002, the work efficiency calculated from calorific equivalents is approximately 30{\%}. We consider the latter to be more ac- curate, since the 02 cost of moving the legs without a load is not included in the calculation. Approaching the calculation of work efficiency thermodynamically, the calculated contrac- tion-coupling efficiency (E,) is 49 {\%}. If a value of 60{\%} is taken for phosphorylative-coupling efficiency (Ep) as suggested in the literature, muscular work efficiency (Em) based on thermo- dynamic considerations, is 29oJ,. The term “efficiency” as used to describe physiological concepts is discussed.},

@article{Hopker2013,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of age, training status, and muscle fiber-type distribution on cycling efficiency. Forty men were recruited into one of four groups: young and old trained cyclists, and young and old untrained individuals. All participants completed an incremental ramp test to measure their peak O2 uptake, maximal heart rate, and maximal minute power output; a submaximal test of cycling gross efficiency (GE) at a series of absolute and relative work rates; and, in trained participants only, a 1-h cycling time trial. Finally, all participants underwent a muscle biopsy of their right vastus lateralis muscle. At relative work rates, a general linear model found significant main effects of age and training status on GE (P {\textless} 0.01). The percentage of type I muscle fibers was higher in the trained groups (P {\textless} 0.01), with no difference between age groups. There was no relationship between fiber type and cycling efficiency at any work rate or cadence combination. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that muscle fiber type did not influence cycling performance (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Power output in the 1-h performance trial was predicted by average O2 uptake and GE, with standardized $\beta$-coefficients of 0.94 and 0.34, respectively, although some mathematical coupling is evident. These data demonstrate that muscle fiber type does not affect cycling efficiency and was not influenced by the aging process. Cycling efficiency and the percentage of type I muscle fibers were influenced by training status, but only GE at 120 revolutions/min was seen to predict cycling performance.},

We simulated reduced gravity using an apparatus that applied a nearly constant upward force at the center of mass, and the subjects walked and ran on a motorized treadmill. In the inverted pendulum model for walking, gravity provides the centripetal force needed to keep the pendulum in contact with the ground. The ratio of the centripetal and gravitational forces (mv2/L)/(mg) reduces to the dimensionless Froude number (v2/gL). Applying this model to a walking human, m is body mass, v is forward velocity, L is leg length and g is gravity. In normal gravity, humans and other bipeds with different leg lengths all choose to switch from a walk to a run at different absolute speeds but at approximately the same Froude number (0.5). We found that, at lower levels of gravity, the walk-run transition occurred at progressively slower absolute speeds but at approximately the same Froude number. This supports the hypothesis that the walk-run transition is triggered by the dynamics of an inverted-pendulum system.},

In both cases, although the dynamics of the bicycle drive system may have an influence on the results, a thorough understanding of the dynamics has not been developed. This study pursued three objectives related to developing such an understanding. The first was to identify the limitations of the inertial/frictional drive system model commonly used in the literature. The second was to investigate the advantages of an inertial/frictional/compliant model. The final objective was to use these models to develop a methodology for configuring a laboratory ergometer to emulate the drive system dynamics of road riding. Experimental data collected from the resulting road-riding emulator and from a standard ergometer confirmed that the inertial/frictional model is adequate for most studies of road-riding mechanics or pedaling coordination. However, the compliant model was needed to reproduce the phase shift in crank angle variations observed experimentally when emulating the high inertia of road riding. This finding may be significant for equipment setup and design studies where crank kinematic variations are important or for motor control studies where fine control issues are of interest.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to further examine the influence of hand-grip strength on power profiles and blood lactate values during high-intensity cycle ergometry. Fifteen male subjects each completed a 20-second cycle ergometer test twice, in a random manner, using two protocols, with a hand grip (WG), and without hand grip (WOHG). Hand-grip strength was quantified prior to exercise using a hand-grip dynamometer. Capillary (earlobe) blood was collected at rest, immediately following exercise, and 5 minutes postexercise. In the WG protocol, mean (+/-SD) blood lactate concentrations were 1.11 +/- 0.7 mmol.l( -1), 3.68 +/- 1.2 mmol.l( -1), and 8.14 +/- 1.3 mmol.l( -1), respectively. During the WOHG protocol, blood lactate values recorded were 0.99 +/- 0.9 mmol.l( -1), 3.68 +/- 1.1 mmol.l( -1), and 6.62 +/- 0.9 mmol.l( -1), respectively. Differences in lactate concentrations were found (P {\textless} 0.05) from rest to 5 minutes postexercise for both groups. Differences in concentrations also were observed between groups at the 5-minutes postexercise stage. Peak power output and fatigue index values also were greater using the WG protocol (792 +/- 73 W vs. 624 +/- 66 W; 38 +/- 6 vs. 24 +/- 8 W respectively; P{\textless} 0.05). No differences were recorded for mean power output (MPO) or work done (WD) between experimental conditions. These findings suggest that the performance of traditional style leg cycle ergometry is influenced by a muscular contribution from the upper body and by upper body strength.},

abstract = {A major criticism of present models of the energetics and mechanics of sprint running concerns the application of estimates of parameters which seem to be adapted from measurements of running during actual competitions. This study presents a model which does not perpetuate this solecism. Using data obtained during supra-maximal cycle ergometer tests of highly trained athletes, the kinetics of the anaerobic and aerobic pathways were modelled. Internal power wasted in the acceleration and deceleration of body limbs and the power necessary to overcome air friction was calculated from data in the literature. Assuming a mechanical efficiency as found during submaximal cycling, a power equation was constructed which also included the power necessary to accelerate the body at the start of movement. The differential equation thus obtained was solved through simulation. The model appeared to predict realistic times at 100 m (10.47 s), 200 m (19.63 s) and 400 m (42.99 s) distances. By comparison with other methods it is argued that power equations of locomotion should include the concept of mechanical efficiency.},

The shape and magnitude of these two types of power have been calculated by measurements of pedal force and cinematographic analysis and the results show fair agreement between them. When cycling at a mean exercise intensity of 340 W at 90 rpm, less than 28 W appears to be lost in the (necessary) changes of segmental energies. It is suggested that power liberated in the joints should be judged as the source of power in the power equation. It is, therefore, proposed that this power should be defined as external power in this and other human movement.},

The basic form of the present model is similar to many previous models of muscle energy expenditure, but parameter values were based almost entirely on mammalian muscle data, with preference given to human data where possible. Nonlinear phenomena associated with submaximal activation were also incorporated. The muscle energy model was evaluated at varying levels of complexity, ranging from simulated contractions of isolated muscle, to simulations of whole body locomotion. In all cases, acceptable agreement was found between simulated and experimental energy liberation.

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

abstract = {The energy cost of internal work and its relationships with lower limb mass and pedalling frequency were studied in four male subjects [age 22.2 (SD 1.5) years, body mass 81.0 (SD 5.1) kg, maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) above resting 3.06 (SD 0.4) l.min-1]. The subjects cycled at 40, 60, 80 and 100 rpm and at five different exercise intensities for every pedalling frequency (unloaded condition, UL); the same exercises were repeated after having increased the lower limbs' masses by 40{\%} (loaded condition, L). The exercise intensities were chosen so that the oxygen consumption (VO2) did not exceed 75{\%} of VO2max. For all the subjects and all the conditions, the rate of VO2 above resting increased linearly with the mechanical power (W). The y-intercepts of the linear regressions of VO2 on W, normalised per kilogram of overall lower limbs mass were the same in both UL and L and increased with the 4.165 power of pedalling frequency (fp). These intercepts were taken to represent the metabolic counterpart of the internal power dissipation in cycling; they amounted to 0.78, 0.34, 3.29 and 10.30 W.kg-1 for pedalling frequencies of 40, 60, 80 and 100 rpm respectively. The slope of the regression lines (delta W/delta VO2) represents the delta efficiency of cycle ergometer exercise; this was also affected by fp, ranging, on average, from 22.9{\%} to 32.0{\%}. These data allowed us to obtain a comprehensive description of the effects of fp (per minute), exercise intensity (W, watts) and lower limbs' mass with or without added loads (mL, kg), on VO2 (ml.min-1) during cycling: VO2 = [mL.(4.3.10(-8).fp4.165/0.35)] + (1/[(3.594.10(-5).fp2 - 0.003.fp + 0.326).0.35]).W. The mean percentage error between the VO2 predicted from this equation and the actual value was 12.6{\%}. This equation showed that the fraction of the overall VO2 due to internal work, for a normal 70-kg subject pedalling at 60 rpm and 100 W was of the order of 0.2.},

Six healthy subjects pedalled a weight-braked bicycle ergometer at 120 watts (W) and 60 revolutions per minute (rpm). The subjects were filmed with a cine camera, and pedal reaction forces were recorded from a force transducer mounted in the pedal. The muscular work at the hip, knee and ankle joint was calculated using a model based upon dynamic mechanics described elsewhere.

At the ankle joint, energy absorption through eccentric plantar flexor action was observed, with a mean peak power of 11.4 W and negative work of 3.4 J for each limb and complete pedal revolution. The energy production relationships between the different major muscle groups were computed and the contributions to the total positive work were: hip extensors, 27{\%}; hip flexors, 4{\%}; knee extensors, 39{\%}; knee flexors, 10{\%}; and ankle plantar flexors 20{\%}.},

abstract = {Internal mechanical work during cycling, required to raise and lower the legs and change their velocities, is shown to be an important factor when interpreting physiological responses to cycle ergometer exercise. The internal work required to move the legs during concentric and eccentric cycle ergometry at different speeds and workloads was calculated from segmental energy changes determined using cinematography and directly using an eccentric ergometer. The mean internal work rates obtained at pedal frequencies of 30, 60 and 90 min-1 were 11.5, 20 and 62 W respectively. When these estimates were added to the external work rates, they increased concentric and decreased eccentric work rates. The largest differences were seen at low work rates and high pedal frequencies during which concentric work rates increased by 51{\%} and eccentric decreased 60{\%} by the inclusion of internal work. When comparisons of concentric and eccentric cycling at equal uncorrected work rates were made, neglecting to include internal work introduced errors ranging from 12 to 97{\%}. The calculated estimates of internal work agreed well with the power supplied by the eccentric ergometer to move the legs passively. The investigations show that the inclusion of internal work is important when comparing physiological responses during concentric and eccentric ergometry, especially when pedal frequencies exceed 60 min-1 and when work rates are small.},

abstract = {Freely chosen pedalling rate during cycling represents a voluntary rhythmic movement. It is unclear to what extent this is influenced by internal (e.g. loading on the cardiopulmonary system) and external (e.g. mechanical loading) conditions. It is also unclear just how robust a voluntary motor rhythm, the freely chosen pedalling rate, actually is. The present study investigated (N = 8) whether or not the freely chosen pedalling rate during submaximal cycling was affected by separate increases in loading on the cardiopulmonary system (changed by exposure to acute simulated altitude of 3,000 m above sea level) and mechanical loading (changed by exposure to increased power output and thereby pedal force). We also investigated (N = 7) whether or not the freely chosen pedalling rate and another voluntary motor rhythm, unimanual unloaded index finger tapping rate, shared common characteristics of steadiness and individuality over a 12-week period. Results showed that the freely chosen pedalling rate was unaffected by increased loading on the cardiopulmonary system at constant mechanical loading, and vice versa. Further, the pedalling rate was steady in the longitudinal perspective (as was the tapping rate), and like tapping rate, pedalling rate was highly individual. In total this indicated that freely chosen pedalling rate primarily is a robust innate voluntary motor rhythm, likely under primary influence of central pattern generators that again are minimally affected by internal and external conditions during submaximal cycling.},

abstract = {To determine whether power-velocity relationships obtained on a nonisokinetic cycle ergometer could be related to muscle fibre type composition, ten healthy specifically trained subjects (eight men and two women) performed brief periods of maximal cycling on a friction loaded cycle ergometer. Frictional force and flywheel velocity were recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz. Power output was computed as the product of velocity and inertial plus frictional forces. Force, velocity and power were averaged over each down stroke. Muscle fibre content was determined by biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle. Maximal down stroke power [14.36 (SD 2.37)W.kg-1] and velocity at maximal power [120 (SD 8) rpm] were in accordance with previous results obtained on an isokinetic cycle ergometer. The proportion of fast twitch fibres expressed in terms of cross sectional area was related to optimal velocity (r = 0.88, P {\textless} 0.001), to squat jump performance (r = 0.78, P {\textless} 0.01) and tended to be related to maximal power expressed per kilogram of body mass (r = 0.60, P = 0.06). Squat jump performance was also related to cycling maximal power. expressed per kilogram of body mass (r = 0.87, P {\textless} 0.01) and to optimal velocity (r = 0.86, P {\textless} 0.01). All these data suggest that the nonisokinetic cycle ergometer is a good tool with which to evaluate the relative contribution of type II fibres to maximal power output. Furthermore, the strong correlation obtained demonstrated that optimal velocity, when related to training status, would appear to be the most accurate parameter to explore the fibre composition of the knee extensor muscle.},

abstract = {Muscle mechanical work is an important biomechanical quantity in human movement analyses and has been estimated using different quantities including external, internal and joint work. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships between these traditionally used estimates of mechanical work in human walking and to assess whether they can be used as accurate estimates of musculotendon and/or muscle fiber work. A muscle-actuated forward dynamics walking simulation was generated to quantify each of the mechanical work measures. Total joint work (i.e. the time integral of absolute joint power over a full gait cycle) was found to underestimate total musculotendon work due to agonist-antagonist co-contractions, despite the effect of biarticular muscle work and passive joint work, which acted to decrease the underestimation. We did find that when the net passive joint work over the gait cycle is negligible, net joint work (i.e. the time integral of net joint power) was comparable to the net musculotendon work (and net muscle fiber work because net tendon work is zero over a complete gait cycle). Thus, during walking conditions when passive joint work is negligible, net joint work may be used as an estimate of net muscle work. Neither total external nor total internal work (nor their sum) provided a reasonable estimate of total musculotendon work. We conclude that joint work is limited in its ability to estimate musculotendon work, and that external and internal work should not be used as an estimation of musculotendon work.},

abstract = {Differences in performance levels between elite male and female endurance athletes are often explained by differences found in VO2 max even when expressed in VO2 max per kilogram lean body mass (VO2/LBM). Such an explanation is only a matter of course when less or no difference exists in mechanical efficiency, anaerobic power and technical variables like friction constants between males and females. Particularly during supramaximal exercises. In this study five elite male speed skaters were compared with five elite female speed skaters with respect to oxygen consumption and external power during a 3 min supramaximal bicycle ergometer test. The training background and training history of both groups were comparable. Although the elite males showed a 20{\%} higher VO2/BW and 8{\%} higher VO2/LBM (71.0 versus 65.01 x min-1 . kg-1) than the females, the female group showed the same mean external power Pc per kilogram body weight, and a surprising 12{\%} higher Pc/LBM than the males (6.47 versus 5.79 W x kg-1). Hence the female group delivered 22{\%} more external power per liter of oxygen consumption. With the help of additional data from 14 male and 11 female sub-elite skaters it is shown that the differences between the elite groups are mainly due to sex differences. In the light of differences between men and women reported in other studies, it seems likely that the differences found in this study are due to a difference in mechanical efficiency which particularly occurs in supramaximal tasks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to study the relationships among movement velocity, torque output and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the knee extensor muscles under eccentric and concentric loading. Fourteen male subjects performed maximal voluntary eccentric and concentric constant-velocity knee extensions at 45, 90, 180 and 360° {\textperiodcentered} s −1 . Myoelectric signals were recorded, using surface electrodes, from the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles. For comparison, torque and full-wave rectified EMG signals were amplitude-averaged through the central half (30°–70°) of the range of motion. For each test velocity, eccentric torque was greater than concentric torque (range of mean differences: 20{\%}–146{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, EMG activity for all muscles was lower under eccentric loading than velocity-matched concentric loading (7{\%}–31{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05). Neither torque output nor EMG activity for the three muscles changed across eccentric test velocities ( P {\textgreater} 0.05). While concentric torque increased with decreasing velocity, EMG activity for all muscles decreased with decreasing velocity ( P {\textless} 0.05). These data suggest that under certain high-tension loading conditions (especially during eccentric muscle actions), the neural drive to the agonist muscles was reduced, despite maximal voluntary effort. This may protect the musculoskeletal system from an injury that could result if the muscle was to become fully activated under these conditions.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article was to establish whether previously reported oxygen-to-mass ratios, used to predict flat and hill-climbing cycling performance, extend to similar power-to-mass ratios incorporating other, often quick and convenient measures of power output recorded in the laboratory [maximum aerobic power (W(MAP)), power output at ventilatory threshold (W(VT)) and average power output (W(AVG)) maintained during a 1 h performance test]. A proportional allometric model was used to predict the optimal power-to-mass ratios associated with cycling speeds during flat and hill-climbing cycling. The optimal models predicting flat time-trial cycling speeds were found to be (W(MAP)m(-0.48))(0.54), (W(VT)m(-0.48))(0.46) and (W(AVG)m(-0.34))(0.58) that explained 69.3, 59.1 and 96.3{\%} of the variance in cycling speeds, respectively. Cross-validation results suggest that, in conjunction with body mass, W(MAP) can provide an accurate and independent prediction of time-trial cycling, explaining 94.6{\%} of the variance in cycling speeds with the standard deviation about the regression line, s=0.686 km h(-1). Based on these models, there is evidence to support that previously reported VO2-to-mass ratios associated with flat cycling speed extend to other laboratory-recorded measures of power output (i.e. Wm(-0.32)). However, the power-function exponents (0.54, 0.46 and 0.58) would appear to conflict with the assumption that the cyclists' speeds should be proportional to the cube root (0.33) of power demand/expended, a finding that could be explained by other confounding variables such as bicycle geometry, tractional resistance and/or the presence of a tailwind. The models predicting 6 and 12{\%} hill-climbing cycling speeds were found to be proportional to (W(MAP)m(-0.91))(0.66), revealing a mass exponent, 0.91, that also supports previous research.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the muscular efficiency during cycling exercise under certain total power output (Ptot) or external power output (Pext) experimental conditions that required a large range of pedal rates from 40 to 120 rpm. Muscular efficiency estimated as a ratio of Ptot, which is sum of internal power output (Pint) and Pext, to rate of energy expenditure above a resting level was investigated in two experiments that featured different conditions on a cycle ergometer, which were carried out at the same levels of Ptot (Exp. 1) and Pext (Exp. 2). Each experiment consisted of three exercise tests with three levels of pedal rates (40, 80 and 120 rpm) lasting for 2-3 min of unloaded cycling followed by 4-5 min of loaded cycling. VO2 during unloaded cycling (approximately 430 ml min(-1) for 40 rpm, approximately 640 ml min(-1) for 80 rpm, approximately 1,600 ml min(-1) for 120 rpm) and the Pint (approximately 3 W for 40 rpm, approximately 25 W for 80 rpm, approximately 90 W for 120 rpm) in the two experiments were markedly increased with increasing pedal rates. The highest muscular efficiency was found at 80 rpm in the two experiments, whereas a remarkable reduction (19{\%}) in muscular efficiency obtained at 120 rpm could be attributable to greater O2 cost due to higher levels of Pint accompanying the increased pedal rates. We concluded that muscular efficiency could be affected by the differences in O2 cost and Pint during cycling under the large range of pedal rates employed in this study.},

abstract = {We focus on the effect of cadence and work rate on energy expenditure and efficiency in cycling, and present arguments to support the contention that gross efficiency can be considered to be the most relevant expression of efficiency. A linear relationship between work rate and energy expenditure appears to be a rather consistent outcome among the various studies considered in this review, irrespective of subject performance level. This relationship is an example of the Fenn effect, described more than 80 years ago for muscle contraction. About 91{\%} of all variance in energy expenditure can be explained by work rate, with only about 10{\%} being explained by cadence. Gross efficiency is strongly dependent on work rate, mainly because of the diminishing effect of the (zero work-rate) base-line energy expenditure with increasing work rate. The finding that elite athletes have a higher gross efficiency than lower-level performers may largely be explained by this phenomenon. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the energetically optimal cadence for cycling because of the multiple factors associated with cadence that affect energy expenditure.},

abstract = {The 'dissection' of energy expenditure of cycling into the metabolic equivalent of the different forms of mechanical work done, inaugurated 30 years ago by di Prampero and collaborators, has been much debated in the last few decades. The mechanical internal work, particularly, which is currently associated to the movement of the lower limbs, has been approached, estimated and discussed in several different ways and there is no agreed consensus on its role in cycling. This paper, through re-processing previously published data of oxygen consumption during pedalling at different frequency, external load and limb mass, proposes a model equation and a multiple non-linear regression as the method to assess the internal work of cycling. With that tool a very consistent metabolic equivalent of the internal work is obtained. However, a software simulation of pedalling limbs showed, as suggested in the literature, that the link with the chain ring allows the system to passively revolve forever, after an initial push. This result challenges the very existence of the 'kinematic internal work' of cycling. We conclude and suggest that the 'viscous internal work', an often neglected and almost unmeasurable portion of the internal work that could be proportional to the 'kinematic' form, is responsible for the extra metabolic expenditure as measured when the pedalling frequency of cycling increases.},

abstract = {A model has recently been proposed to predict the changes of mechanical power (W) during a maximal explosive effort (such as a standing high jump off both feet) following an adaptation (e.g. training/de-training). The model is based on the assumption that, all other things being equal (ceteris paribus), the predicted changes in W depend on the measured changes of muscle force (F) or cross-sectional area (CSA) only. It follows that, if the measured changes in W are not equal to those predicted by the model, factors other than a change in F (or CSA) must be responsible for this difference. The model does not allow the determination of factors specifically involved in the adaptation process but it helps in discriminating whether an adaptation has taken place at a local level (when the observed changes in F would be attributed to factors other than the observed changes in CSA, e.g. co-contractions, fibre type modifications...), or at a central level (when the observed changes in W would be attributed to other factors than the observed changes in F, e.g. co-ordination of multiple joints and muscle groups...), or in both regions. In this paper the model has been applied to data reported in the literature on disuse (BR, bed rest), de-conditioning (SF, space flight), strength training (ST) and de-training (DT). The results of these calculations have confirmed previous observations on the determinants of the adaptation process and further suggest: (1) that training for one specific motor task (e.g. ST) could affect the performance of a second task (e.g. a maximal explosive jump) but that, as soon as the trained motor task is terminated (DT), this ability is re-gained; and (2) that neuromuscular impairment in disuse (BR) is closer to de-training than to the de-conditioning brought about by weightlessness (SF).},

abstract = {In cycling the gear determines the distance travelled and the mean applied force at each leg thrust. According to Padilla et al. (J Appl Physiol 89:1522-1527, 2000), an elite cyclist was able to cycle for an hour at 14.6 m.s(-1 developing 510 W at a pedal frequency of 101 rpm. Thus, the opposing force was 34 N (=500/14.6), whereas the mean force, developed by the leg muscles, was 144.1 N. It can be calculated that in the same subject cycling on a 20{\%} slope at the same pedal frequency, the velocity would be reduced by about 5 times, i.e. to 2.9 m.s(-1) because of a fivefold increase of the opposing force. In reality, the increase of mean force developed by leg muscles is even larger, because of the fall of the cadence to 60 rpm. In general, during mountain ascents cyclists develop high forces at low cadences that are likely to be more economical; in contrast, on flat ground, they increase the pedalling rates because their aerodynamic posture does not allow high force production. The intermittent pattern of muscular force application generates speed changes that become more evident at great inclines and low cadences. It can be shown that inertial work is appreciable in cycling, increasing with the incline of the road and decreasing with the cadence. However, inertial work does not seem to affect efficiency. Differences in physiologic potential make differences in performance more evident in time trials where the mean incline of the road is not negligible. Cyclists with low body size have an advantageous force versus mass ratio in high mountain ascents.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study into high-intensity cycling was to: (1) test the hypothesis that endurance time is longest at a freely chosen pedalling rate (FCPR), compared to pedalling rates 25{\%} lower (FCPR-25) and higher (FCPR+25) than FCPR, and (2) investigate how physiological variables, such as muscle fibre type composition and power reserve, relate to endurance time. Twenty males underwent testing to determine their maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), power output corresponding to 90{\%} of VO(2max) at 80 rpm (W90), FCPR at W90, percentage of slow twitch muscle fibres ({\%} MHC I), maximal leg power, and endurance time at W90 with FCPR-25, FCPR, and FCPR+25. Power reserve was calculated as the difference between applied power output at a given pedalling rate and peak crank power at this same pedalling rate. W90 was 325 (47) W. FCPR at W90 was 78 (11) rpm, resulting in FCPR-25 being 59 (8) rpm and FCPR+25 being 98 (13) rpm. Endurance time at W90(FCPR+25) [441 (188) s] was significantly shorter than at W90(FCPR) [589 (232) s] and W90(FCPR-25) [547 (170) s]. Metabolic responses such as VO(2) and blood lactate concentration were generally higher at W90(FCPR+25) than at W90(FCPR-25) and W90(FCPR). Endurance time was negatively related to VO(2max), W90 and {\%} MHC I, while positively related to power reserve. In conclusion, at group level, endurance time was longer at FCPR and at a pedalling rate 25{\%} lower compared to a pedalling rate 25{\%} higher than FCPR. Further, inter-individual physiological variables were of significance for endurance time, {\%} MHC I showing a negative and power reserve a positive relationship.},

abstract = {Many studies have attempted to describe the optimal cadence in cycling. However, the effect on performance has received little attention. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the effect of cadence on performance during prolonged cycling (approximately 30 min). Fourteen male elite cyclists performed two or five time trials at different cadences [60, 80, 100, 120 rpm or freely chosen cadence (FCC)]. The total work was the same between the time trials, and the subjects were instructed to complete each time trial as fast as possible by adjusting the workload with buttons mounted on the handlebar. Accumulated work and cadence was visualised on a monitor. Oxygen uptake was measured continuously and blood lactate concentration every fifth minute. Compared to 80 rpm, finishing times at 60, 100 and 120 rpm were 3.5, 1.7 and 10.2{\%} slower (P{\textless}0.05). Finishing time at FCC (mean 90 rpm) was indistinguishable from 80 and 100 rpm. Gross efficiency at 80 rpm was 2.9, 2.3, 3.4 and 12.3{\%} larger than at 60, FCC, 100 and 120 rpm, respectively (P{\textless}0.05). The maximal energy turnover rate was 1.7{\%} higher at 100 than at 80 rpm (P{\textless}0.05). This could not, however, compensate for the 3.4{\%} lower efficiency at 100 rpm. This study demonstrated that elite cyclists perform best at their most efficient cadence despite the maximal energy turnover rate being larger at a higher cadence.},

abstract = {The metabolic cost and the mechanical work of running at different speeds and gradients were measured on five human subjects. The mechanical work was partitioned into the internal work (Wint) due to the speed changes of body segments with respect to the body centre of mass and the external work (Wext) due to the position and speed changes of the body centre of mass in the environment. Wext was further divided into a positive part (W + ext) and a negative part (W Ϫ ext), associated with the energy increases and decreases, respectively, over the stride period. For all constant speeds, the most economical gradient was Ϫ10.6±0.5 {\%} (S.D., N=5) with a metabolic cost of 146.8±3.8 ml O2 kg Ϫ1 km Ϫ1 . At each gradient, there was a unique W + ext/W Ϫ ext ratio (which was 1 in level running), irrespective of speed, with a tendency for W Ϫ ext and W + ext to disappear above a gradient of +30 {\%} and below a gradient of Ϫ30 {\%}, respectively. Wint was constant within each speed from a gradient of Ϫ15 {\%} to level running. This was the result of a nearly constant stride frequency at all negative gradients. The constancy of Wint within this gradient range implies that Wint has no role in determining the optimum gradient. The metabolic cost C was predicted from the mechanical experimental data according to the following equation: where eff Ϫ (0.80), eff + (0.18) and eff i (0.30) are the efficiencies of W Ϫ ext, W + ext and Wint, respectively, and el Ϫ and el + represent the amounts of stored and released elastic energy, which are assumed to be 55 J step Ϫ1 . The predicted C versus gradient curve coincides with the curve obtained from metabolic measurements. We conclude that W + ext/W Ϫ ext partitioning and the eff + /eff Ϫ ratio, i.e. the different efficiency of the muscles during acceleration and braking, explain the metabolic optimum gradient for running of about Ϫ10 {\%}.},

abstract = {The influence of contraction type on the human ability to use the torque capacity of skeletal muscle during explosive efforts has not been documented. Fourteen male participants completed explosive voluntary contractions of the knee extensors in four separate conditions: concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC); and isometric at two knee angles (101°, ISO101 and 155°, ISO155). In each condition, torque was measured at 25 ms intervals up to 150 ms from torque onset, and then normalized to the maximum voluntary torque (MVT) specific to that joint angle and angular velocity. Explosive voluntary torque after 50 ms in each condition was also expressed as a percentage of torque generated after 50 ms during a supramaximal 300 Hz electrically evoked octet in the same condition. Explosive voluntary torque normalized to MVT was more than 60 per cent larger in CON than any other condition after the initial 25 ms. The percentage of evoked torque expressed after 50 ms of the explosive voluntary contractions was also greatest in CON (ANOVA; p {\textless} 0.001), suggesting higher concentric volitional activation. This was confirmed by greater agonist electromyography normalized to M(max) (recorded during the explosive voluntary contractions) in CON. These results provide novel evidence that the ability to use the muscle's torque capacity explosively is influenced by contraction type, with concentric contractions being more conducive to explosive performance due to a more effective neural strategy.},

abstract = {Muscle contractions that load in-series springs with slow speed over a long duration do maximal work and store the most elastic energy. However, time constraints, such as those experienced during escape and predation beha- viours, may prevent animals from achieving maximal force capacity from their muscles during spring-loading. Here, we ask whether animals that have limited time for elastic energy storage operate with springs that are tuned to submaximal force production. To answer this question, we used a dynamic model of a muscle–spring system undergoing a fixed-end contrac- tion, with parameters from a time-limited spring-loader (bullfrog: Lithobates catesbeiana) and a non-time-limited spring-loader (grasshopper: Schistocerca gregaria).We found that when muscles have less time to contract, stored elastic energy is maximized with lower spring stiffness (quantified as spring constant). The spring stiffness measured in bullfrog tendons permitted less elastic energy storage than was predicted by a modelled, maximal muscle contraction.However,whenmuscle contractionsweremodelled using biologi- cally relevant loading times for bullfrog jumps (50 ms), tendon stiffness actually maximized elastic energy storage. In contrast, grasshoppers, which are not time limited, exhibited spring stiffness that maximized elastic energy storage when modelled with a maximal muscle contraction. These findings demonstrate the significance of evolutionary variation in tendon and apodeme properties to realistic jumping contexts as well as the importance of consi- dering the effect of muscle dynamics and behavioural constraints on energy storage in muscle–spring systems.},

abstract = {Muscular forces generated during locomotion depend on an animal's speed, gait, and size and underlie the energy demand to power locomotion. Changes in limb posture affect muscle forces by altering the mechanical advantage of the ground reaction force (R) and therefore the effective mechanical advantage (EMA = r/R, where r is the muscle mechanical advantage) for muscle force production. We used inverse dynamics based on force plate and kinematic recordings of humans as they walked and ran at steady speeds to examine how changes in muscle EMA affect muscle force-generating requirements at these gaits. We found a 68{\%} decrease in knee extensor EMA when humans changed gait from a walk to a run compared with an 18{\%} increase in hip extensor EMA and a 23{\%} increase in ankle extensor EMA. Whereas the knee joint was extended (154-176 degrees) during much of the support phase of walking, its flexed position (134-164 degrees) during running resulted in a 5.2-fold increase in quadriceps impulse (time-integrated force during stance) needed to support body weight on the ground. This increase was associated with a 4.9-fold increase in the ground reaction force moment about the knee. In contrast, extensor impulse decreased 37{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05) at the hip and did not change at the ankle when subjects switched from a walk to a run. We conclude that the decrease in limb mechanical advantage (mean limb extensor EMA) and increase in knee extensor impulse during running likely contribute to the higher metabolic cost of transport in running than in walking. The low mechanical advantage in running humans may also explain previous observations of a greater metabolic cost of transport for running humans compared with trotting and galloping quadrupeds of similar size.},

Simply adding mass proportionally changes both the weight (gravitational force) and mass (inertial force) of the animal. We measured ground reaction forces for eight male humans running normally at 3 m s(-)(1) and under three experimental treatments: added gravitational and inertial forces, added inertial forces and reduced gravitational forces. Subjects ran at 110, 120 and 130 {\%} of normal weight and mass, at 110, 120 and 130 {\%} of normal mass while maintaining 100 {\%} normal weight, and at 25, 50 and 75 {\%} of normal weight while maintaining 100 {\%} normal mass. The peak active vertical forces generated changed with weight, but did not change with mass. Surprisingly, horizontal impulses changed substantially more with weight than with mass. Gravity exerted a greater influence than inertia on both vertical and horizontal forces generated against the ground during running. Subjects changed vertical and horizontal forces proportionately at corresponding times in the step cycle to maintain the orientation of the resultant vector despite a nearly threefold change in magnitude across treatments. Maintaining the orientation of the resultant vector during periods of high force generation aligns the vector with the leg to minimize muscle forces.},

In a series of experiments, subjects ran in both normal and flexed postures on a treadmill. In other experiments, they ran down a runway and over a force platform. Results show that running with the knees bent reduces the effective vertical stiffness and diminishes the transmission of mechanical shock from the foot to the skull but requires an increase of as much as 50{\%} in the rate of O2 consumption. A new dimensionless parameter (u omega 0/g) is introduced to distinguish between hard and soft running modes. Here, omega 0 is the natural frequency of a mass-spring system representing the body, g is gravity, and u is the vertical landing velocity. In normal running, this parameter is near unity, but in deep-flexed running, where the aerial phase of the stride cycle almost disappears, u omega 0/g approaches zero.},

abstract = {Compliant tendons permit mechanically unfavourable fascicle dynamics during fixed-end contractions. The purpose of this study was to reduce the effective compliance of tendon and investigate how small reductions in active shortening affect twitch kinetics and contractile performance in response to a second stimulus. The series elastic element (SEE) of the human triceps surae (N=15) was effectively stiffened by applying a 55 ms rotation to the ankle, through a range of 5°, at the onset of twitch and doublet [interstimulus interval (ISI) of 80 ms] stimulation. Ultrasonography was employed to quantify lateral gastrocnemius and soleus fascicle lengths. Rotation increased twitch torque (40-75{\%}), rate of torque development (RTD, 124-154{\%}) and torque-time integral (TTI, 70-110{\%}) relative to constant-length contractions at the initial and final joint positions, yet caused only modest reductions in shortening amplitude and velocity. The torque contribution of the second pulse increased when stimulation was preceded by rotation, a finding unable to be explained on the basis of fascicle length or SEE stiffness during contraction post-rotation. A further increase in torque contribution was not demonstrated, nor an increase in doublet TTI, when the second pulse was delivered during rotation and shortly after the initial pulse (ISI of 10 ms). The depressant effect of active shortening on subsequent torque generation suggests that compliant tendons, by affording large length changes, may limit torque summation. Our findings indicate that changes in tendon compliance shown to occur in response to resistance training or unloading are likely sufficient to considerably alter contractile performance, particularly maximal RTD.},

abstract = {Work output of rat gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle (N = 5) was measured for stretch-shortening contractions, in which initiation of stretch occurred prior to the onset of activation, and for contractions with an isometric prephase. Duration of the active prephase (prestretch and pre-isometric) varied from 20 to 200 ms. Subsequent shortening (from optimum length + 4 mm to optimum length -2mm) lasted 150 ms. Stretch velocities of 5, 10 and 20 mm s-1 were used, and the shortening velocity was 40 mm s-1. The effects of several combinations of active stretch duration and active stretch amplitude were compared. Using force-compliance characteristics, the work of the contractile element (CE), elastic energy storage and release of the undamped series elastic component (SEC) were distinguished. During shortening, an extra amount of work output was produced, induced by active stretch, of which the largest contribution (70-80{\%}) was due to higher elastic energy release. Enhancement of the storage and utilization of elastic energy during the stretch-shortening cycle, caused by higher transition-point forces (i.e. force at onset of shortening), increased with active stretch amplitude and was associated with a net loss of work, probably due to cross-bridge detachment during active stretch. Net work over the stretch-shortening cycle remained positive for all prestretch contractions, indicating that when a muscle performs this type of contraction, it is able to contribute to work performance on body segments. It is concluded that, in stretch-shortening movements of rat GM muscle, maximal positive work output is incompatible with maximal net work output. Consequences for complex movements in vivo are discussed.},

abstract = {The importance of bilateral sensorimotor signals in coordination of locomotion has been demonstrated in animals but is difficult to ascertain in humans due to confounding effects of mechanical transmission of forces between the legs (i.e., mechanical interleg coupling). In a previous pedaling study, by eliminating mechanical interleg coupling, we showed that muscle coordination of a unipedal task can be shaped by interlimb sensorimotor pathways. Interlimb neural pathways were shown to alter pedaling coordination as subjects pedaling unilaterally exhibited increased flexion-phase muscle activity compared with bilateral pedaling even though the task mechanics performed by the pedaling leg(s) in the unilateral and bilateral pedaling tasks were identical. To further examine the relationship between contralateral sensorimotor state and ipsilateral flexion-phase muscle coordination during pedaling, subjects in this study pedaled with one leg while the contralateral leg either generated an extensor force or relaxed as a servomotor either held that leg stationary or moved it in antiphase with the pedaling leg. In the presence of contralateral extensor force generation, muscle activity in the pedaling leg during limb flexion was reduced. Integrated electromyographic activity of the pedaling-leg hamstring muscles (biceps femoris and semimembranosus) during flexion decreased by 25–30{\%}, regardless of either the amplitude of force generated by the nonpedaling leg or whether the leg was stationary or moving. In contrast, rectus femoris and tibialis anterior activity during flexion decreased only when the contralateral leg generated high rhythmic force concomitant with leg movement. The results are consistent with a contralateral feedforward mechanism triggering flexion-phase hamstrings activity and a contralateral feedback mechanism modulating rectus femoris and tibialis anterior activity during flexion. Because only muscles that contribute to flexion as a secondary function were observed, it is impossible to know whether the modulatory effect also acts on primary, unifunctional, limb flexors or is specific to multifunctional muscles contributing to flexion. The influence of contralateral extensor-phase sensorimotor signals on ipsilateral flexion may reflect bilateral coupling of gain control mechanisms. More generally, these interlimb neural mechanisms may coordinate activity between muscles that perform antagonistic functions on opposite sides of the body. Because pedaling and walking share biomechanical and neuronal control features, these mechanisms may be operational in walking as well as pedaling.},

abstract = {Leg kinematics during backward walking (BW) are very similar to the time-reversed kinematics during forward walking (FW). This suggests that the underlying muscle activation pattern could originate from a simple time reversal, as well. Experimental electromyography studies have confirmed that this is the case for some muscles. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that muscles showing a time reversal should also exhibit a reversal in function [from accelerating the body center of mass (COM) to decelerating]. However, this has not yet been verified in simulation studies. In the present study, forward simulations were used to study the effects of muscles on the acceleration of COM in FW and BW. We found that a reversal in function was indeed present in the muscle control of the horizontal movement of COM (e.g., tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius). In contrast, muscles' antigravity contributions maintained their function for both directions of movement. An important outcome of the present study is therefore that similar muscles can be used to achieve opposite functional demands at the level of control of the COM when walking direction is reversed. However, some muscles showed direction-specific contributions (i.e., dorsiflexors). We concluded that the changes in muscle contributions imply that a simple time reversal would be insufficient to produce BW from FW. We therefore propose that BW utilizes extra elements, presumably supraspinal, in addition to a common spinal drive. These additions are needed for propulsion and require a partial reconfiguration of lower level common networks.},

abstract = {Mammalian skeletons experience peak locomotor stresses (force per area) that are 25 to 50{\%} of their failure strength, indicating a safety factor of between two and four. The mechanism by which animals achieve a constant safety factor varies depending on the size of the animal. Over much of their size (0.1 to 300 kilograms), larger mammals maintain uniform skeletal stress primarily by having a more upright posture, which decreases mass-specific muscle force by increasing muscle mechanical advantage. At greater sizes, increased skeletal allometry and decreased locomotor performance likely maintain stresses constant. At smaller sizes, skeletal stiffness may be more critical than strength. The decrease in mass-specific muscle force in mammals weighing 0.1 to 300 kilogram indicates that peak muscle stresses are also constant and correlates with a decrease in mass-specific energy cost of locomotion. The consistent pattern of locomotor stresses developed in long bones at different speeds and gaits within a species may have important implications for how bones adaptively remodel to changes in stress.},

The rolling resistance and air resistance of each vehicle were assessed. The mechanical internal work (W(INT)) was measured from three-dimensional motion analysis of the Hobby Horse and modern bicycle moving on a treadmill at different speeds. The equation obtained from the modern bicycle data was applied to the other vehicles. We found the following results. (i) Apart from the Rover, which was introduced for safety reasons, every newly invented bicycle improved metabolic economy. (ii) The rolling resistance decreased with subsequent designs while the frontal area and, hence, aerodynamic drag was fairly constant (except for the High Wheeler). (iii) The saddle-assisted body weight relief (which was inaugurated by the Hobby Horse) was responsible for most of the reduction in metabolic cost compared with walking or running. Further reductions in C were due to decreases in stride/pedalling frequency and, hence, W(INT) at the same speeds. (iv) The introduction of gear ratios allowed the use of pedalling frequencies that optimize the power/contraction velocity properties of the propulsive muscles. As a consequence, net mechanical efficiency (the ratio between the total mechanical work and C) was almost constant (0.273 +/- 0.015s.d.) for all bicycle designs, despite the increase in cruising speed. In the period from 1820 to 1890, improved design of bicycles increased the metabolically equivalent speed by threefold compared with walking at an average pace of ca. + 0.5 ms(-1) per decade [corrected]. The speed gain was the result of concurrent technological advancements in wheeled, human-powered vehicles and of 'smart' adaptation of the same actuator (the muscle) to different operational conditions.},

abstract = {An important function of skeletal muscle is deceleration via active muscle fascicle lengthening, which dissipates movement energy. The mechanical interplay between muscle contraction and tendon elasticity is critical when muscles produce energy. However, the role of tendon elasticity during muscular energy dissipation remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that tendon elasticity functions as a mechanical buffer, preventing high (and probably damaging) velocities and powers during active muscle fascicle lengthening. We directly measured lateral gastrocnemius muscle force and length in wild turkeys during controlled landings requiring rapid energy dissipation. Muscle-tendon unit (MTU) strain was measured via video kinematics, independent of muscle fascicle strain (measured via sonomicrometry). We found that rapid MTU lengthening immediately following impact involved little or no muscle fascicle lengthening. Therefore, joint flexion had to be accommodated by tendon stretch. After the early contact period, muscle fascicles lengthened and absorbed energy. This late lengthening occurred after most of the joint flexion, and was thus mainly driven by tendon recoil. Temporary tendon energy storage led to a significant reduction in muscle fascicle lengthening velocity and the rate of energy absorption. We conclude that tendons function as power attenuators that probably protect muscles against damage from rapid and forceful lengthening during energy dissipation.},

Missing from such instrumentation, however, is any demand for balance and the fraction of the metabolic cost associated with dynamic balance. An alternative training device, rollers, may provide a more ecologically valid simulation of overground riding because dynamic balance is required. The purpose of this study was to compare oxygen consumption (VO2) at a similar power level during cycling on an ergometer, trainer, and rollers. Highly-trained cyclists (n = 7, VO2 peak = 65 ± 5 mL?kg-1?min-1) performed a VO2 - 2 peak on three cycling devices in randomized order. On rollers and stationary trainer, power was measured via a Power Tap SL+ hub and on the ergometer, using resistance. Matching of mechanical power across all 3 modes, as it correlates to VO2 2 peak test. Mean VO2 values at constant power levels were: rollers = 49.2 ± 5.2, trainer = 48.0 ± 5.2, and ergometer = 48.0 ± 4.8 mL?kg-1?min-1. Riding on rollers required 2.5{\%} greater VO2 compared to riding a stationary trainer or ergometer at the same mechanical power level (p {\textless} 0.05). This increase was likely due to the metabolic cost of balance associated with cycling on rollers and suggests that rollers may better simulate the metabolic cost of overground cycling at approximatlye 70{\%} of VO2 peak},

abstract = {The muscles that power vertebrate locomotion are associated with springy tissues, both within muscle and in connective tissue elements such as tendons. These springs share in common the same simple action: they stretch and store elastic strain energy when force is applied to them and recoil to release energy when force decays. Although this elastic action is simple, it serves a diverse set of functions, including metabolic energy conservation, amplification of muscle power output, attenuation of muscle power input, and rapid mechanical feedback that may aid in stability. In recent years, our understanding of the mechanisms and importance of biological springs in locomotion has advanced significantly, and it has been demonstrated that elastic mechanisms are essential for the effective function of the muscle motors that power movement. Here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of elastic mechanisms, with an emphasis on two proposed organizing principles. First, we review the evidence that the various functions of biological springs allow the locomotor system to operate beyond the bounds of intrinsic muscle properties, including metabolic and mechanical characteristics, as well as motor control processes. Second, we propose that an energy-based framework is useful for interpreting the diverse functions of series-elastic springs. In this framework, the direction and timing of the flow of energy between the body, the elastic element and the contracting muscle determine the function served by the elastic mechanism (e.g. energy conservation vs power amplification). We also review recent work demonstrating that structures such as tendons remodel more actively and behave more dynamically than previously assumed.},

abstract = {During locomotion cyclical interchange between different forms of mechanical energy enhances economy; however, 100{\%} efficiency cannot be achieved and ultimately some mechanical work must be performed de novo. There is a metabolic cost associated with fluctuations in mechanical energy, even in the most efficient animals. In this study we investigate the exchanges between different forms of mechanical energy involved in high-speed gallop locomotion in Thoroughbred race horses during over-ground locomotion using innovative, mobile data collection techniques. We use hoof-mounted accelerometers to capture foot contact times, a GPS data logger to monitor speed and an inertial sensor mounted over the dorsal spinous processes of the fourth to sixth thoracic vertebrae (the withers) of the horse to capture trunk movement with six degrees of freedom. Trunk movement data were used to estimate the movement of the centre of mass (CoM). Linear (craniocaudal, mediolateral and dorsoventral) and rotational (roll, pitch and heading) kinematic parameters (displacement, velocity and acceleration) were calculated for seven horses at gallop speeds ranging from 7 to 17 m s(-1) during their regular training sessions. These were used to estimate external mechanical energy (potential energy and linear kinetic energy of the CoM) as well as selected components of internal energy (angular kinetic energy). Elastic energy storage in the limbs was estimated from duty factor, sine wave assumptions and published leg stiffness values. External mechanical energy changes were dominated by changes in craniocaudal velocity. Potential energy change, which was in phase with craniocaudal energy during the front limb stances, was small. Elastic energy storage in the limbs was small compared to the overall amplitude of fluctuation of external mechanical energy. Galloping at high speeds does not therefore fit classical spring mass mechanics.},

However, others facilitate observations that would be difficult to make on real organisms, for example on the flow of air around the wings of small insects. Mathematical models have been used more often than physical ones. Some of them are predictive, designed for example to calculate the effects of anatomical changes on jumping performance, or the pattern of flow in a 3D assembly of semicircular canals. Others seek an optimum, for example the best possible technique for a high jump. A few have been used in inverse optimization studies, which search for variables that are optimized by observed patterns of behaviour. Mathematical models range from the extreme simplicity of some models of walking and running, to the complexity of models that represent numerous body segments and muscles, or elaborate bone shapes.

In this study, the kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the centre of mass of the whole human body was measured (using a force platform) simultaneously with calculation of the kinetic and potential energy of the body segments due to their movements relative to the body centre of mass (using cinematography) at different speeds of walking and running. Upper and lower boundaries to the total work were determined by including or excluding possible energy transfers between the segments of each limb, between the limbs and between the centre of mass of the body and the limbs. It appears that the muscle-tendon work of locomotion is most accurately measured when energy transfers are only included between segments of the same limb, but not among the limbs or between the limbs and the centre of mass of the whole body.},

abstract = {The vertical excursion of the body center of mass (BCOM) was calculated using three different techniques commonly used by motion analysis laboratories. The sacral marker method involved estimating vertical BCOM motion by tracking the position of a reflective marker that was placed on the sacrum of subjects as they walked. The body segmental analysis technique determined the vertical motion of the BCOM from a weighted average of the vertical positions of the centers of mass of individual body segments for each frame of kinematic data acquired during the data trial. Anthropomorphic data from standard tables were used to determine the mass fractions and the locations of the centers of mass of each body segment. The third technique involved calculating BCOM vertical motion through double integration of force platform data. Data was acquired from 10 able-bodied, adult research subjects - 5 males and 5 females - walking at speeds of 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 m/s. A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that at the slowest walking speed the vertical excursions calculated by all three techniques were similar, but at faster speeds the sacral marker significantly (p{\textless}0.001) overestimated the vertical excursion of the BCOM compared with the other two methods. The body segmental analysis and force platform techniques were in agreement at all walking speeds. Discrepancies between the sacral marker method and the other two techniques were explained using a simple model; the reciprocal configuration of the legs during double support phase significantly raises the position of the BCOM within the trunk at longer step lengths, corresponding to faster walking speeds. The sacral marker method may provide a reasonable approximation of vertical BCOM motion at slow and freely selected speeds of able-bodied walking. However, the body segmental analysis or force platform techniques will probably yield better estimates at faster walking speeds or in persons with gait pathologies. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {While it has been suggested that bi-articular muscles have a specialized role in directing external reaction forces, it is unclear how humans learn to coordinate mono- and bi-articular muscles to perform force-directing tasks. Participants were asked to direct pedal forces in a specified target direction during one-legged cycling. We expected that with practice, performance improvement would be associated with specific changes in joint torque patterns and mono- and bi-articular muscular coordination. Nine male participants practiced pedaling an ergometer with only their left leg, and were instructed to always direct their applied pedal force perpendicular to the crank arm (target direction) and to maintain a constant pedaling speed. After a single practice session, the mean error between the applied and target pedal force directions decreased significantly. This improved performance was accompanied by a significant decrease in the amount of ankle angular motion and a smaller increase in knee and hip angular motion. This coincided with a re-organization of lower extremity joint torques, with a decrease in ankle plantarflexor torque and an increase in knee and hip flexor torques. Changes were seen in both mono- and bi-articular muscle activity patterns. The mono-articular muscles exhibited greater alterations, and appeared to contribute to both mechanical work and force-directing. With practice, a loosening of the coupling between bi-articular thigh muscle activation and joint torque co-regulation was observed. The results demonstrated that participants were able to learn a complex and dynamic force-directing task by changing the direction of their applied pedal forces through re-organization of joint torque patterns and mono- and bi-articular muscle coordination. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Equestrian sports are unique in that they involve the participation of two athletes that differ greatly in morphology yet are able to move together harmoniously; experienced riders not only move in phase with the horse, they can even improve the consistency of the horse's movements. The motion of the horse imposes perturbations on the rider that differ in magnitude and direction according to gait. In faster gaits where suspension phases are present, the rider must accommodate greater vertical and horizontal accelerations of the horse's trunk through three-dimensional movements of their axial body segments. The rider, in turn, can improve the horse's performance through correct training, or cause it to deteriorate through faults in the rider's position or incorrect application of the aids. This review addresses the current state of knowledge of the biomechanics of the horse-rider interaction, with reference to the ways in which the emerging field of equitation science can help to improve equine welfare by enhancing rider awareness of horse behaviour and movement, as well as the impact of the rider on the horse.},

abstract = {Eight experienced male cyclists (C), eight well-trained male runners (R), and eight less-trained male noncyclists (LT) were tested under multiple cadence and power output conditions to determine: (1) if the cadence at which lower extremity net joint moments are minimized (cost function cadence) was associated with preferred pedaling cadence (PC), (2) if the cost function cadence increased with increases in power output, and (3) if the association is generalizable across groups differing in cycling experience and aerobic power. Net joint moments at the hip, knee, and ankle were computed from video records and pedal reaction force data using 2-D inverse dynamics. The sum of the average absolute hip, knee, and ankle joint moments defined a cost function at each power output and cadence and provided the basis for prediction of the cadence which minimized net joint moments for each subject at each power output. The cost function cadence was not statistically different from the PC at each power output in all groups. As power output increased, however, the cost function cadence increased for all three subject groups (86 rpm at 100 W, 93 rpm at 150 W, 98 rpm at 200 W, and 96 rpm at 250 W). PC showed little change (R) or a modest decline (C, LT) with increasing power output. Based upon the similarity in the mean data but different trends in the cost function cadence and PC in response to changes in power output as well as the lack of significant correlations between these two variables, it was concluded that minimizing net joint moments is a factor modestly associated with preferred cadence selection.},

abstract = {A simple model represents oscillatory movements such as many animals use for running, swimming or flight. A plate is oscillated in a fluid by a pair of muscles that exert the forces needed to overcome its inertia and hydrodynamic drag. The muscles have spring-like tendons. Empirically-based equations that take account of the force exerted by a muscle and the rate at which it is shortening are used to estimate the metabolic energy cost of the oscillation. The maximum shortening speed (vmax) of the muscles and the elastic compliance of their tendons are varied to find the optimum combination that minimizes metabolic cost. If hydrodynamic forces predominate (as in swimming), the cost is highly sensitive to muscle speed (which should be relatively high) but less sensitive to compliance. If inertial forces predominate (as in running) the cost is highly sensitive to tendon compliance, and less sensitive to muscle speed (which should preferably be low). The muscles that power the locomotion of various animals are discussed in the light of these conclusions.},

SD 1.2 years old) and 17 older (61.7 ?? 5.5 years old) adults completed six STS trials at three speeds: slow, normal, and fast. Sagittal plane joint torques at the hip, knee, and ankle were calculated through inverse dynamics. Isometric and isokinetic maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) for the hip, knee, and ankle were collected and used for model parameters to predict the participant-specific maximum voluntary joint torque. Three different measures of relative effort were determined by normalizing STS joint torques to three different estimates of maximum voluntary torque. Relative effort at the hip, knee, and ankle were higher when accounting for variations in maximum voluntary torque with joint angle and angular velocity (hip = 26.3 ?? 13.5{\%}, knee = 78.4 ?? 32.2{\%}, ankle = 27.9 ?? 14.1{\%}) compared to methods which do not account for these variations (hip = 23.5 ?? 11.7{\%}, knee = 51.7 ?? 15.0{\%}, ankle = 20.7 ?? 10.4{\%}). At higher velocities, the difference in calculating relative effort with respect to isometric MVC or incorporating joint angle and angular velocity became more evident. Estimates of relative effort that account for the variations in maximum voluntary torque with joint angle and angular velocity may provide higher levels of accuracy compared to methods based on measurements of maximal isometric torques. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to manipulate bicycle seat height in order to perturbate muscle length, contraction velocity and excitation of soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles. One group of female riders (n = 13) rode a stationary ergometer at 200 W and a cadence of 80 rpm. Individuals rode at a self-selected seat height, a 10{\%} lowered and 5{\%} raised seat position. It was hypothesized that because the two muscles would operate at decreased contraction velocities at the low seat, the integrated EMG would be less for the lowest seat position. The soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles showed a significant decrease in integrated EMG value with decreased seat height (soleus F2,24 = 5.4, p {\textless} 0.01, gastrocnemius F2,24 = 51.6, p {\textless} 0.0001). The combined effect of the movement at the ankle and knee joints resulted in increased length of gastrocnemius rather than shortening at the lowered seat-height position as anticipated. This suggested that there was a greater role of knee-joint angle in determining the muscle excitation for medial gastrocnemius. The original hypothesis was accepted, confirming the importance of setting proper seat height. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Right pedal forces and lower limb kinematics of ten cyclists were measured throughout a fatigue cycling test at 100{\%} of POMAX. The absolute net joint moments, resultant force and kinematics were calculated for the hip, knee and ankle joint through inverse dynamics. The contribution of each joint to the total net joint moments was computed. Decreased pedaling cadence was observed followed by a decreased ankle moment contribution to the total joint moments in the end of the test. The total absolute joint moment, and the hip and knee moments has also increased with fatigue. Resultant force was increased, while kinematics has changed in the end of the test for hip, knee and ankle joints. Reduced ankle contribution to the total absolute joint moment combined with higher ankle force and changes in kinematics has indicated a different mechanical function for this joint. Kinetics and kinematics changes observed at hip and knee joint was expected due to their function as power sources. Kinematics changes would be explained as an attempt to overcome decreased contractile properties of muscles during fatigue. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Eleven subjects pedaled for five loaded conditions (220 W, 190 W, 160 W, 130 W, 100 W) and one unloaded condition at 80 rpm. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of six lower limb muscles, pedal forces and oxygen consumption were calculated for every condition. Muscle activity was defined by timing (EMG onset and offset) and level (integrated values of EMGrms calculated between EMG onset and EMG offset) of activation, while horizontal and vertical impulses were computed to characterize pedal forces. Muscle activity, pedal forces and oxygen consumption variables measured during the unloaded condition were compared with those extrapolated to 0 W from the loaded conditions, assuming a linear relationship. The muscle activity was changed during unloaded condition: EMG onset and/or offset of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, vastus medialis, and gluteus maximus muscles were delayed (p {\textless} 0.05); iEMGrms values of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior muscles were higher than those extrapolated to 0 W (p {\textless} 0.05). Vertical impulse over the extension phase was lower (p {\textless} 0.05) while backward horizontal impulse was higher (p {\textless} 0.05) during unloaded condition than those extrapolated to 0 W.

Timing of activation of rectus femoris and biceps femoris was dramatically modified to optimize pedal forces and maintain a constant cadence, while systematic changes in the activation level of the bi-articular muscles induced a relative increase in metabolic expenditure when pedaling during an unloaded condition. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Manual digitisation of these images is time consuming and algorithms for automating the process have been developed. Here we present a freely available software implementation of a previously validated algorithm for semi-automated tracking of muscle fascicle length in dynamic ultrasound image recordings, "UltraTrack". Methods: UltraTrack implements an affine extension to an optic flow algorithm to track movement of the muscle fascicle end-points throughout dynamically recorded sequences of images. The underlying algorithm has been previously described and its reliability tested, but here we present the software implementation with features for: tracking multiple fascicles in multiple muscles simultaneously; correcting temporal drift in measurements; manually adjusting tracking results; saving and re-loading of tracking results and loading a range of file formats. Results: Two example runs of the software are presented detailing the tracking of fascicles from several lower limb muscles during a squatting and walking activity. Conclusion: We have presented a software implementation of a validated fascicle-tracking algorithm and made the source code and standalone versions freely available for download.},

abstract = {Purpose. - The aim of this work was to study the effect of the posture on the preferred pedalling frequency during uphill cycling. Methods and results. - Ten trained cyclists performed two pedalling trials of three minutes at 80{\%} of maximal aerobic power on a treadmill with a slope of 4{\%}. Two postures (seated and standing pedalling) were studied in a randomized order. During the first minute of each trial, the subjects had to choose their preferred pedalling frequency with adjusting their gear and then kept this rate until the end of the trial. The preferred pedalling frequency was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) lower in standing (73±7 rpm) than in seated pedalling (80±9rpm). Conclusion. - We suppose that cyclists choose a lower pedalling frequency during standing pedalling in order to generate greater peak pedal force and to decrease the number of lateral sways of bicycle and vertical elevations of pelvis, which increase energy cost. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {Modulating speed over a large range is important in walking, yet understanding how the neuromotor patterns adapt to the changing energetic demands of different speeds is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to identify functional and energetic adaptations in individual muscles in response to walking at faster steady-state speeds using muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations. The simulation data were invariant with speed as to whether muscles contributed to trunk support, forward propulsion or leg swing. Trunk support (vertical acceleration) was provided primarily by the hip and knee extensors in early stance and the plantar flexors in late stance, while trunk propulsion (horizontal acceleration) was provided primarily by the soleus and rectus femoris in late stance, and these muscle contributions all systematically increased with speed. The results also highlighted the importance of initiating and controlling leg swing as there was a dramatic increase at the higher walking speeds in iliopsoas muscle work to accelerate the leg in pre- and early swing, and an increase in the biarticular hamstring muscle work to decelerate the leg in late swing. In addition, walking near self-selected speeds (1.2 m/s) improves the utilization of elastic energy storage and recovery in the uniarticular ankle plantar flexors and reduces negative fiber work, when compared to faster or slower speeds. These results provide important insight into the neuromotor mechanisms underlying speed regulation in walking and provide the foundation on which to investigate the influence of walking speed on various neuromotor measures of interest in pathological populations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: This review summarizes the effects of bilateral asymmetry on running and cycling performance and risk of injury in healthy subjects and the influence of leg preference. We define the term leg preference derived from lateral preference as representative of the choice for one side of the body to perform a motor action. Useful information is provided for biomechanical and physiological research and coaching with relevance to an understanding regarding the occurrence of lower limb asymmetry. Objectives: To provide a synopsis of what is known about bilateral asymmetry in human running and cycling and its relationship to limb preference, especially in the context of competitive sport performance and risk of injury. Design: Structured narrative review. Methods: The relationship between asymmetry and lower limb preference was reviewed using Medline??, Sciencedirect??, and Scopus?? search engines considering studies published in English until June 2009. Summary: The environment characteristics may influence running asymmetries, which are more frequent in angular parameters. Environment characteristics are related to ground irregularities requiring compensatory movements changing the mechanical workload on joints and bones, which may influence asymmetries in biomechanical parameters between lower limbs. The relationship between asymmetry and injury risk should be assessed with caution since running speed may influence asymmetry in injured and non-injured subjects who often show similar asymmetry levels. Symmetry can be improved with increasing running speed. In addition to running speed, coaches and athletes interested in minimizing lateral difference should consider a training regime aimed at correcting asymmetry which may negatively affect running technique by influencing the compensatory movements that an athlete usually performs. During cycling, bilateral differences are frequently found and vary with the competitive situation, pedaling cadence, exercise intensity and exercise duration. Regardless of the variability of asymmetry index between subjects, few suggestions are available to overcome lateral differences. Most of the research suggests that bilateral pedaling asymmetries decrease as the workload increases, however the relationship to injury risk was not clearly addressed. For both running and cycling, few investigations examined the central mechanisms of neuromuscular control, and no study addressed the effect of asymmetry on performance. Conclusions: Collectively, the volume of studies supporting symmetry is small and to a large extent research considered unilateral assessment. Preferred limb performance can differ from the contralateral limb. In the context of biomechanical and physiological investigations, we believe that further studies should address the role of lower limb symmetry on human motor performance and injury risk focusing on the energetic cost, muscle efficiency and the neuromuscular aspects such as muscle activation and motor units firing rate. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe training variations across the annual cycle in Olympic and World Champion endurance athletes, and determine whether these athletes used tapering strategies in line with recommendations in the literature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eleven elite XC skiers and biathletes (4 male; 28±1 yr, 85±5 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) VO2max, 7 female, 25±4 yr, 73±3 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) VO2max) reported one year of day-to-day training leading up to the most successful competition of their career. Training data were divided into periodization and peaking phases and distributed into training forms, intensity zones and endurance activity forms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Athletes trained ∼800 h/500 sessions x year(-1), including ∼500 h x year(-1) of sport-specific training. Ninety-four percent of all training was executed as aerobic endurance training. Of this, ∼90{\%} was low intensity training (LIT, below the first lactate threshold) and 10{\%} high intensity training (HIT, above the first lactate threshold) by time. Categorically, 23{\%} of training sessions were characterized as HIT with primary portions executed at or above the first lactate turn point. Training volume and specificity distribution conformed to a traditional periodization model, but absolute volume of HIT remained stable across phases. However, HIT training patterns tended to become more polarized in the competition phase. Training volume, frequency and intensity remained unchanged from pre-peaking to peaking period, but there was a 32±15{\%} (P{\textless}.01) volume reduction from the preparation period to peaking phase.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The annual training data for these Olympic and World champion XC skiers and biathletes conforms to previously reported training patterns of elite endurance athletes. During the competition phase, training became more sport-specific, with 92{\%} performed as XC skiing. However, they did not follow suggested tapering practice derived from short-term experimental studies. Only three out of 11 athletes took a rest day during the final 5 days prior to their most successful competition.},

abstract = {Vertebrate animals exploit the elastic properties of their tendons in several different ways. Firstly, metabolic energy can be saved in locomotion if tendons stretch and then recoil, storing and returning elastic strain energy, as the animal loses and regains kinetic energy. Leg tendons save energy in this way when birds and mammals run, and an aponeurosis in the back is also important in galloping mammals. Tendons may have similar energy-saving roles in other modes of locomotion, for example in cetacean swimming. Secondly, tendons can recoil elastically much faster than muscles can shorten, enabling animals to jump further than they otherwise could. Thirdly, tendon elasticity affects the control of muscles, enhancing force control at the expense of position control. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Roberts2002a,
abstract = {The mechanical roles of tendon and muscle contractile elements during locomotion are often considered independently, but functionally they are tightly integrated. Tendons can enhance muscle performance for a wide range of locomotor activities because muscle-tendon units shorten and lengthen at velocities that would be mechanically unfavorable for muscle fibers functioning alone. During activities that require little net mechanical power output, such as steady-speed running, tendons reduce muscular work by storing and recovering cyclic changes in the mechanical energy of the body. Tendon stretch and recoil not only reduces muscular work, but also allows muscle fibers to operate nearly isometrically, where, due to the force-velocity relation, skeletal muscle fibers develop high forces. Elastic energy storage and recovery in tendons may also provide a key mechanism to enable individual muscles to alter their mechanical function, from isometric force-producers during steady speed running to actively shortening power-producers during high-power activities like acceleration or uphill running. Evidence from studies of muscle contraction and limb dynamics in turkeys suggests that during running accelerations work is transferred directly from muscle to tendon as tendon stretch early in the step is powered by muscle shortening. The energy stored in the tendon is later released to help power the increase in energy of the body. These tendon length changes redistribute muscle power, enabling contractile elements to shorten at relatively constant velocities and power outputs, independent of the pattern of flexion/extension at a joint. Tendon elastic energy storage and recovery extends the functional range of muscles by uncoupling the pattern of muscle fiber shortening from the pattern of movement of the body. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Objectives When compared to seated, the standing position allows the production of higher power outputs during intense cycling. We hypothesized that muscle coordination could explain this advantage. To test this hypothesis, we assessed muscle activity over a wide range of power outputs for both seated and standing cycling positions. Design Nine lower limb muscle activities from seventeen untrained volunteers were recorded during cycling sequences performed in the seated and the standing positions at power outputs ranging from ∼100 to 700 W at 90 ± 5 revolutions-per-minute (RPM). Methods Integrated electromyography activity (iEMG), temporal patterns of the EMGs, and muscle synergies were analyzed. Results Muscle activity was underlain by four muscle synergies in both positions. Muscle synergies were similar in the two positions (Pearson's r = 0.929 ± 0.125). The activation patterns of knee and ankle extensor muscles and their associated synergies had different timings in the two positions (differences of ∼2–10{\%} of cycle). No major timing changes were observed with power output ({\textless}2{\%} of cycle). Differences in iEMG between the two positions depended strongly on power output in all but the calf muscle (medial gastrocnemius). Conclusions The number and structure of the muscle synergies play a minor role in the advantage of using the standing position when cycling at high power-outputs. However, the standing position is favorable in terms of iEMG at power outputs ≳500–600 W due to position-dependent modulations of muscle activation levels. These data are important for understanding the determinants of the seat-stand transition in cycling.},

abstract = {In this commentary we question whether the relationship between muscle ac-tivity and joint moments is the same for natural motor tasks as for controlled experimental situations. An important consideration in this regard is the iden-tification of the correct electromechanical delay (EMD) for comparing EMG and joint moment data. Data from recent cycling studies are used to illustrate the importance of EMD, and how changing task constraints can alter the rela-tion between muscle activity and joint moment balance for bi-articular an-tagonist pairs. The target article (Prilutsky, 1999) gives a good overview of mono-and bi-articular muscle function together with an intriguing hypothesis that the basic fea-tures of such muscular control can be predicted by optimization models based on minimization of muscle stress cubed. In our commentary, we will focus on the basic issue of one-and two-joint muscle coordination. Central features of the co-ordination strategy described in the target article are (a) that mono-articular muscles increase their activation when they act as agonists at joints that require increased moments, or in an antagonistic role when a bi-articular counterpart is active, and (b) that bi-articular muscle activation depends strongly on the combination of moments required at the two joints that they cross. This second feature is sup-ported by data illustrating the relationship between the difference in activity for bi-articular muscle pairs and the difference in moments for the joints that they cross (Figures 2 {\&} 3 of Prilutsky, 1999). The relationship between muscle activity difference (rectus femoris [RF] EMG -hamstrings [HA] EMG) and joint moment difference (knee moment -hip moment) is shown for two controlled experiments.

abstract = {Background: A number of models have been developed to establish the energy cost of cycling. These models have become better refined to account for the various energy demands, including air and rolling resistances. Among the established models, however, there does not appear to be sufficient consideration for changes to internal mechanical power (IP), the rate of energy to move the limbs against gravitational and inertial forces. Values up to 100 W have been reported for IP in cycling for cadences between 80 and 115 , and so the inclusion of IP in performance prediction models is arguably warranted. Quantifying IP has previously been done using either 1) a physiological approach (IP met ), in which the metabolic counterpart of the external mechanical power (power applied to the cranks) was subtracted from Ė (energy expenditure) to equal the metabolic equivalent of IP met , which was then multiplied by delta efficiency (DE) to yield the IP met ; or 2) a biomechanical approach (IP mech ), which used an inverse dynamics analysis of the kinematics and kinetics of cycling. Both approaches have notable advantages and limitations, which is why quantifying a range for IP, delimited by IP met  and IP mech,  has been proposed by this research group.       Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess whether incorporating a range of values for IP into an established performance model would provide a better prediction of Ė than when IP was not included.       Methods: Steady-state Ė was measured (K4 b 2 , Cosmed, Rome, Italy) for 10 elite male cyclists who cycled for 5-6 min at 200 W at 80 and 110  on the flat duckboard of an outdoor velodrome in calm conditions. Steady-state Ė was compared to Ė predicted by the established model (Equation 1, see in PDF document) (di Prampero et al. 1979: Journal of Applied Physiology, 47(1), 201-106; Olds et al. Journal of Applied Physiology, 75(2), 730-737):  and Ė predicted by the model that includes IP (IP met  and IP mech ) (Equation 2, see in PDF document):   where the first term of both equations represents the cost due to air resistance and includes a coefficient of drag (C drag ), the projected frontal surface area (A frontal ), the air density (r), the velocity of the wind (v w ) and the steady-state velocity of the cyclist (v ss ). The second term represents the cost due to rolling resistance, where C rr  is the coefficient of rolling resistance, S is the angle of terrain, m body  and m bicycle  are the masses of the participant's body and bicycle, respectively. IP met  and IP mech  were determined in the laboratory for each cyclist in an identical cycling position to that adopted in the outdoor trials.   Results: Mean (± s) measured  at 80  was 866 W (± 78 W) and at 110  was 937 W (± 75 W). The mean difference (± 95{\%} limits of agreement) between measured  and  predicted by Equation 1 was -98 W (± 214 W) at 80  and -185 W (± 191 W) at 110 . When IP met  was included in the prediction (Equation 2), mean differences (± 95{\%} limits of agreement) were 125 W (± 192 W) and 182 W (± 153 W) at 80 and 110 , respectively. The mean differences (± 95{\%} limits of agreement) between measured  and  predicted by Equation 2 incorporating IP mech  were -48 W (± 201 W) at 80  and -148 W (± 274 W) at 110 .   Discussion: Energy expenditure () predicted using an already-established model was shown, in this study, to fall short of the  measured from respiratory gas during outdoor cycling for most participants at 80  and for all at 110 . Inclusion of IP mech  into the performance prediction model resulted in values closer to the measured , however they were not sufficiently large enough to account for the entire deficit from the original prediction model (Equation 1) at either cadence.  When the upper limit of the IP range, IP met , was incorporated it more than compensated, in almost all cases, for the deficit from Equation 1. That is to say, the  measured during outdoor cycling fell within the range of values that was predicted for  when estimates of IP were considered in the model.   Conclusion: Based on these results, it is recommended that future predictions of cycling performance include a cost for IP.},

This type of spring-mass model has been used to describe the stance period of symmetric running gaits. In this study, we investigated the interaction between horse and rider at trot using three models of force-driven spring (-damper)-mass systems. The first system consisted of a spring and a mass representing the horse that interact with another spring and mass representing the rider. In the second spring-damper-mass model, dampers, a free-fall and a forcing function for the rider were incorporated. In the third spring-damper-mass model, an active spring system for the leg of the rider was introduced with a variable spring stiffness and resting length in addition to a saddle spring with fixed material properties. The output of the models was compared with experimental data of sitting and rising trot and with the modern riding technique used by jockeys in racing. The models show which combinations of rider mass, spring stiffness and damping coefficient will result in a particular riding technique or other behaviours. Minimization of the peak force of the rider and the work of the horse resulted in an 'extreme' modern jockey technique. The incorporation of an active spring system for the leg of the rider was needed to simulate rising trot. Thus, the models provide insight into the biomechanical requirements a rider has to comply with to respond effectively to the movements of a horse.},

abstract = {1. Human flexor reflex (HFR) responses were elicited during ergometer cycling in neurologically intact humans with the objective of understanding the influence of lower limb muscle activity on phase-dependent reflex modulation during movement. The experimental setup permitted control over background muscle activity and stimulus intensity without significantly interfering with the cycling motion. 2. All experiments involved cycling on an ergometer at a set rate and workload. A 333-Hz, 15-ms pulse train of electrical stimulation was randomly delivered to the skin over the tibial nerve at the ankle at selected lower limb positions. In the first group of experiments, subjects were stimulated at six cycling phases while pedaling with normal, phasic ankle activity (free-form cycling). The second and third group of experiments involved stimulation under static limb positioning conditions and during active pedaling while subjects were asked to maintain a consistent background level of isolated tibialis anterior (TA) or soleus (SOL) electromyographic (EMG) activity. 3. Control criteria were established to assure similar isolated muscle EMG levels and sensory stimulation intensities throughout the experiments. With the aid of the application of a lower extremity brace and visual EMG feedback, SOL and TA activity were confined by the subject to a narrow range during the task of cycling. Stimulus consistency was achieved through maintenance of flexor hallucis brevis M-waves to within an envelope encompassing the mean value +/- 5{\%} of the maximum M-wave amplitude in all experimental conditions. 4. When the subject's limb was statically positioned, the HFR responses in the SOL muscle showed no significant changes in pattern when compared at various limb positions. During cycling with consistent SOL activity, a response waveform pattern of early-latency-long-duration depression was followed by a later-latency facilitation response in all positions except the initial power phase. The initial power phase was characterized by an additional early-latency facilitation in all but one subject. 5. In the TA muscle response, no change in onset latency (57.5 +/- 0.8 ms, mean +/- SD), waveform pattern, or response amplitude (7.9 +/- 1.1{\%} maximal voluntary contraction, mean +/- SD) was observed during static limb positioning. Significant increases in response amplitude (P {\textless} 0.05) coupled with significant increases (9.2 ms, P {\textless} 0.05) in onset latency were seen during the transition from the recovery phase to the power phase during cycling. In addition, there was no correlation between the prestimulation baseline level and the onset latency during controlled TA cycling activity conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Locomotion requires uninterrupted transitions between limb extension and flexion. The role of contralateral sensorimotor signals in executing smooth transitions is little understood even though their participation is crucial to bipedal walking. However, elucidating neural interlimb coordinating mechanisms in human walking is difficult because changes to contralateral sensorimotor activity also affect the ipsilateral mechanics. Pedaling, conversely, is ideal for studying bilateral coordination because ipsilateral mechanics can be independently controlled. In pedaling, the anterior and posterior bifunctional thigh muscles develop needed anterior and posterior crank forces, respectively, to dominate the flexion-to-extension and extension-to-flexion transitions. We hypothesized that contralateral sensorimotor activity substantially contributes to the appropriate activation of these bifunctional muscles during the limb transitions. Bilateral pedal forces and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from four thigh muscles were collected from 15 subjects who pedaled with their right leg against a right-crank servomotor, which emulated the mechanical load experienced in conventional two-legged coupled-crank pedaling. In one pedaling session, the contralateral (left) leg pseudo-pedaled (i.e., EMG activity and pedal forces were pedaling-like, but pedal force was not allowed to affect crank rotation). In other sessions, the mechanically decoupled contralateral leg was first relaxed and then produced rhythmic isometric force trajectories during either leg flexion or one of the two limb transitions of the pedaling leg. With contralateral force production in the extension-to-flexion transition (predominantly by the hamstrings), rectus femoris activity and work output increased in the pedaling leg during its flexion-to-extension transition, which occurs simultaneously with contralateral extension-to-flexion in conventional pedaling. Similarly, with contralateral force production in the other transition (i.e., flexion-to-extension; predominantly by rectus femoris), hamstrings activity and work output increased in the pedaling leg during its extension-to-flexion transition. Therefore rhythmic isometric force generation in the contralateral leg supported the ongoing bifunctional muscle activity and resulting work output in the pedaling leg. The results suggest that neural interlimb coordinating mechanisms fine-tune bifunctional muscle activity in rhythmic lower-limb tasks to ensure limb flexion/extension transitions are executed successfully.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine if independent central pattern generating elements controlling the legs in bipedal and unipedal locomotion is a viable theory for locomotor propulsion in humans. Coordinative coupling of the limbs could then be accomplished through mechanical interactions and ipsilateral feedback control rather than through central interlimb neural pathways. Pedaling was chosen as the locomotor task to study because interlimb mechanics can be significantly altered, as pedaling can be executed with the use of either one leg or two legs (cf. walking) and because the load on the limb can be well-controlled. Subjects pedaled a modified bicycle ergometer in a two-legged (bilateral) and a one-legged (unilateral) pedaling condition. The loading on the leg during unilateral pedaling was designed to be identical to the loading experienced by the leg during bilateral pedaling. This loading was achieved by having a trained human "motor" pedal along with the subject and exert on the opposite crank the torque that the subject's contralateral leg generated in bilateral pedaling. The human "motor" was successful at reproducing each subject's one-leg crank torque. The shape of the motor's torque trajectory was similar to that of subjects, and the amount of work done during extension and flexion was not significantly different. Thus the same muscle coordination pattern would allow subjects to pedal successfully in both the bilateral and unilateral conditions, and the afferent signals from the pedaling leg could be the same for both conditions. Although the overall work done by each leg did not change, an 86{\%} decrease in retarding (negative) crank torque during limb flexion was measured in all 11 subjects during the unilateral condition. This corresponded to an increase in integrated electromyography of tibialis anterior (70{\%}), rectus femoris (43{\%}), and biceps femoris (59{\%}) during flexion. Even given visual torque feedback in the unilateral condition, subjects still showed a 33{\%} decrease in negative torque during flexion. These results are consistent with the existence of an inhibitory pathway from elements controlling extension onto contralateral flexion elements, with the pathway operating during two-legged pedaling but not during one-legged pedaling, in which case flexor activity increases. However, this centrally mediated coupling can be overcome with practice, as the human "motor" was able to effectively match the bilateral crank torque after a longer practice regimen. We conclude that the sensorimotor control of a unipedal task is affected by interlimb neural pathways. Thus a task performed unilaterally is not performed with the same muscle coordination utilized in a bipedal condition, even if such coordination would be equally effective in the execution of the unilateral task.},

abstract = {The hypothesis which motivated the work reported in this article was that neglecting pure moments developed between the foot and pedal during cycling leads to a substantial error in computing axial and varus/valgus moments at the knee. To test this hypothesis, a mathematical procedure was developed for computing the three-dimensional knee loads using three-dimensional pedal forces and moments. In addition to data from a six-load-component pedal dynamometer, the model used pedal position and orientation and knee position in the frontal plane to determine the knee joint loads. Experimental data were collected from the right leg of 11 male subjects during steady-state cycling at 90 rpm and 225 W. The mean peak varus knee moment calculated was 15.3 N m and the mean peak valgus knee moment was 11.2 N m. Neglecting the pedal moment about the anterior/posterior axis resulted in an average absolute error of 2.6 N m and a maximum absolute error of 4.0 N m in the varus/valgus knee moment. The mean peak internal and external axial knee moments were 2.8 N m and 2.3 N m, respectively. The average and maximum absolute errors in the axial knee moment for not including the moment about an axis normal to the pedal were found to be 2.6 N m and 5.0 N m, respectively. The results strongly support the use of three-dimensional pedal loads in the computation of knee joint moments out of the sagittal plane. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {This article presents an analytical technique for decomposing the pedal force in cycling into a muscular component due directly to the net intersegmental moments and a nonmuscular component due to gravitational and inertial effects. The decomposition technique uses the Newton-Euler system of dynamic equations for the leg segments to solve for the two components, given the planar segmental kinematics and the intersegmental moments. Applications of the technique to cycling studies of muscle function, pedalling effectiveness, and optimization analyses based on inverse dynamics are discussed. While this article focuses on the pedal force in cycling, the decomposition method can be directly applied to analyze the reaction forces during a general planar movement of the leg when the segmental kinematics and intersegmental moments are specified. This article also demonstrates the significance of the nonmuscular component relative to the muscular component by performing the decomposition of the pedal forces of an example subject who pedalled at three different cadences against a common work load. The key results were that the nonmuscular components increased in magnitude as the cadence increased, whereas the magnitude of the muscular component remained relatively constant over the majority of the crank cycle. Also, even at the slowest pedalling rate of 70 rpm, the magnitude of the nonmuscular component was substantial. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {The amount of mechanical energy transferred by two-joint muscles between leg joints during squat vertical jumps, during landings after jumping down from a height of 0.5 m, and during jogging were evaluated experimentally. The experiments were conducted on five healthy subjects (body height, 1.68-1.86 m, and mass, 64-82 kg). The coordinates of the markers on the body and the ground reactions were recorded by optical methods and a force platform, respectively. By solving the inverse problem of dynamics for the two-dimensional, four-link model of a leg with eight muscles, the power developed by the joint (net muscular) moments and the power developed by each muscle were determined. The energy transferred by two-joint muscles from and to each joint was determined as a result of the time integration of the difference between the power developed at the joint by the joint moment, and the total power of the muscles serving a given joint. It was shown that during a squat vertical jump and in the push-off phase during running, the two-joint muscles (rectus femoris and gastrocnemius) transfer mechanical energy from the proximal joints of the leg to the distal ones. At landing and in the shock-absorbing phase during running, the two-joint muscles transfer energy from the distal to proximal joints. The maximum amount of energy transferred from the proximal joints to distal ones was equal to 178.6 ?? 45.7 J (97.1 ?? 27.2{\%} of the work done by the joint moment at the hip joint) at the squat vertical jump. The maximum amount of energy transferred from the distal to proximal joints was equal to 18.6 ?? 4.2 J (38.5 ?? 36.4{\%} of work done by the joint moment at the ankle joint) at landing. The conclusion was made that the one-joint muscles of the proximal links compensate for the deficiency in work production of the distal one-joint muscles by the distribution of mechanical energy between joints through the two-joint muscles. During the push-off phase, the muscles of the proximal links help to extend the distal joints by transferring to them a part of the generated mechanical energy. During the shock-absorbing phase, the muscles of the proximal links help the distal muscles to dissipate the mechanical energy of the body.},

Monoarticular muscles produce an endpoint force that is directed in the lengthwise direction of the limb, i.e. in the direction of one of the segments. The force from biarticular muscles can have a marked transverse component. The 'principal direction' of this endpoint force is also the movement direction of the endpoint which is the most favourable for the muscle to do work.

abstract = {In many arm or leg movements the hand or foot has to exert an external force on the environment. Based on an inverse dynamical analysis of cycling, it is shown that the distribution of net moments in the joints needed to control the direction of the external force is often opposite to the direction of joint displacements associated with this task. Kinetic and kinematic data were obtained from five experienced cyclists during ergometer cycling by means of film analysis and pedal force measurement. An inverse dynamic analysis, based on a linked segments model, yielded net joint moments, joint powers and muscle shortening velocities of eight leg muscles. Activation patterns of the muscles were obtained by means of surface electromyography. The results show that the transfer of rotations in hip, knee and ankle joints into the translation of the pedal is constrained by conflicting requirements. This occurs between the joint moments necessary to contribute to joint power and the moments necessary to establish a direction of the force on the pedal which allows this force to do work on the pedal. Co-activation of mono-articular agonists and their bi-articular antagonists appear to provide a unique solution for these conflicting requirements: bi-articular muscles appear to be able to control the desired direction of the external force on the pedal by adjusting the relative distribution of net moments over the joints while mono-articular muscles appear to be primarily activated when they are in the position to shorten and thus to contribute to positive work. Examples are given to illustrate the universal nature of this constrained control of force (external) and position (joint). Based on this study and published data it is suggested that different processes may underlie the organization of the control of mono- and bi-articular muscles. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {The common denominator in the assessment of human balance and posture is the inverted pendulum model. If we focus on appropriate versions of the model we can use it to identify the gravitational and acceleration perturbations and pinpoint the motor mechanisms that can defend against any perturbation. We saw that in quiet standing an ankle strategy applies only in the A P direction and that a separate hip load/unload strategy by the hip abd/adductors is the totally dominant defence in the M L direction when standing with feet side by side. In other standing positions (tandem, or intermediate) the two mechanisms still work separately, but their roles reverse. In the tandem position M L balance is an ankle mechanism (invertors/evertors) while in the A P direction a hip load/unloading mechanism dominates. During initiation and termination of gait these two separate mechanisms control the trajectory of the COP to ensure the desired acceleration and deceleration of the COM. During initiation the initial acceleration of the COM forward towards the stance limb is achieved by a posterior and lateral movement of the COP towards the swing limb. After this release phase there is a sudden loading of the stance limb which shifts the COP to the stance limb. The COM is now accelerated forward and laterally towards the future position of the swinging foot. Also M L shifts of the COP were controlled by the hip abductors/adductors and all A P shifts were under the control of the ankle plantar/dorsiflexors. During termination the trajectory of both COM and COP reverse. As the final weight-bearing on the stance foot takes place the COM is passing forward along the medial border of that foot. Hyperactivity of that foot's plantarflexors takes the COP forward and when the final foot begins to bear weight the COP moves rapidly across and suddenly stops at a position ahead of the future position of the COM. Then the plantarflexors of both feet release and allow the COP to move posteriorly and approach the COM and meet it as quiet stance is achieved. The inverted pendulum model permitted us to understand the separate roles of the two mechanisms during these critical unbalancing and rebalancing periods. During walking the inverted pendulum model explained the dynamics of the balance of HAT in both the A P and M L directions. Here the model includes the couple due to the acceleration of the weight-bearing hip as well as gravitational perturbations. The exclusive control of A P bala{\ldots}},

abstract = {Most purposive movements are multi-joint actions in which specific patterns of joint moments are necessary to achieve the required segmental accelerations and to exert the appropriate direction and magnitude of force on the environment. Both human and animal studies suggest that mono- and biarticular muscles have different roles in these complex movements. Monoarticular muscles appear to show simple flexor or extensor activation patterns closely related to the required joint displacements, whereas biarticular muscles often exhibit complex multiple bursts of activity aimed at a fine-regulation of the distribution of net moments over the joints of the limb. Different patterns of activation of mono- and biarticular muscles have been observed during natural movements and in response to sudden perturbations or peripheral afferent inputs. Evidence is provided that the control of mono- and biarticular muscles is based on different processes and different sources of information. Monoarticular muscles may be more rigidly grouped into simple flexor or extensor synergies, whereas biarticular muscle activity may be more flexibly sculpted by motion-related feedback from peripheral afferents. Little is known about where and how the integration between perceptual information and the control of net joint moment is realized. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {From an analysis of cycling, it was hypothesized that mono- and bi-articular muscles may have different roles in the control of contact control tasks. The aim of the present study is to find experimental evidence for this hypothesis. On a special dynamometer, subjects were instructed to exert a force in a prescribed direction while the forceplate was either fixed (isometric) or slowly moving downwards (isokinetic). Joint positions, reaction forces and EMG-activity from six upper leg muscles were recorded. All subjects performed the tasks very accurately with a stereotyped muscle activation pattern. Comparing the mean EMG-values for the isometric and isokinetic condition, the mono-articular muscles showed a significantly higher activity in the dynamic situation, whereas the activity of the biarticular muscles was similar for both conditions. For the antagonistic biarticular muscles, a linear relationship was found for the difference in their EMG-activity (Rectus Femoris-Hamstrings) and the difference in hip and knee joint moments. Apparently, the two biarticular muscles function in a reciprocal way to regulate the distribution of net moments about the joints, whereas the activation of the mono-articular muscles appeared to depend on the type of task. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Ultrasound imaging has recently been used to distinguish the length changes of muscle fascicles from those of the whole muscle tendon complex during real life movements. The complicated three-dimensional architecture of pennate muscles can however cause heterogeneity in the length changes along the length of a muscle. Here we use ultrasonography to examine muscle fascicle length and pennation angle changes at proximal, distal and midbelly sites of the human gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle during walking (4.5 km/h) and running (7.5 km/h) on a treadmill. The results of this study have shown that muscle fascicles perform the same actions along the length of the human GM muscle during locomotion. However the distal fascicles tend to shorten more and act at greater pennation angles than the more proximal fascicles. Muscle fascicles acted relatively isometrically during the stance phase during walking, however during running the fascicles shortened throughout the stance phase, which corresponded to an increase in the strain of the series elastic elements (SEEs) (consisting of the Achilles tendon and aponeurosis). Measurement of the fascicle length changes at the midbelly level provided a good approximation of the average fascicle length changes across the length of the muscle. The compliance of the SEE allows the muscle fascicles to shorten at a much slower speed, more concomitant with their optimal speed for maximal power output and efficiency, with high velocity shortening during take off in both walking and running achieved by recoil of the SEE. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Tendon elasticity is important for economical locomotion; however it is unknown whether tendon stiffness is appropriate to achieve an optimal efficiency in various muscles. Here we test the hypothesis that the Achilles tendon is of an appropriate stiffness to maximise medial gastrocnemius muscle efficiency during locomotion with different power requirements. To test this hypothesis we used a three element Hill muscle model to determine how muscle fascicles would be required to change length if the series elastic element stiffness is varied, whilst the limb kinematics and muscle properties are held constant. We applied a model of muscle energetics to these data to predict muscle efficiency for a range of stiffness values in both walking and running conditions. We also compared the model results to in vivo data collected using ultrasonography. The muscle model predicted that optimal series elastic element stiffness for maximising efficiency is equal or slightly higher than that of the average Achilles tendon in running and walking, respectively. Although the peak efficiency values for running (26{\%}) and walking (27{\%}) are similar, the range of stiffness values achieving high efficiency in running is much smaller than that during walking. These results suggest that a compliant tendon, such as the Achilles tendon, is required for efficient running. Such a finding is important, because it describes how the stiffness of a tendon may be adapted to achieve optimal efficiency for particular athletic pursuits. The influence of varying tendon stiffness on kinematic performance may, however, play an important role in determining the efficiency of the muscle. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Force enhancement is a well accepted property of skeletal muscle and has been observed at all structural levels ranging from single myofibrils to voluntarily activated m. quadriceps femoris in vivo. However, force enhancement has not been studied for multi-joint movements like human leg extension; therefore knowledge about its relevance in daily living remains limited. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is force enhancement during maximal voluntary multi-joint leg extension. Human leg extension was studied (n=22) on a motor driven leg press dynamometer where external reaction forces under the feet as well as activity of 8 lower extremity muscles were measured. In addition, torque in the ankle and knee joints was calculated using inverse dynamics. The steady-state isometric force, joint torques, and muscle activation after active stretch (20° stretch amplitude at 60°/s) were compared with the corresponding values obtained during isometric reference contractions. There was consistent force enhancement during and following stretch for both forces and joint torques. Potentiation during stretch reached values between 26{\%} and 30{\%}, while a significant force enhancement of 10.5-12.3{\%} and 4.3-7.4{\%} remained 0.5-1 and 2.5-3. s after stretch, respectively. During stretch, EMG signals of m. gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis were significantly increased, while following stretch all analyzed muscles showed the same activity as during the reference contractions. We conclude from these results that force enhancement exists in everyday movements and should be accounted for when analyzing or modelling human movement. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Instantaneous contractile characteristics of skeletal muscle, during movement tasks, can be determined and related to steady state mechanical properties such as the force-length relationship with the use of ultrasound imaging. A previous investigation into the contractile characteristics of the vastus lateralis (VL) during cycling has shown that fascicles operate on the "weak" descending limb of the force-length relationship, thus not taking advantage of the "strong" plateau region. The purpose of this study was to investigate if VL fascicle lengths change from sub-maximal to maximal cycling conditions, and if maximal cycling results in VL fascicle lengths which operate across the plateau of the force-length relationship. Fifteen healthy male subjects (age 20.9??1.8. yr, wt. 67.0??6.3. kg, ht. 176.7??7.2. cm) were tested to establish the maximal force-length relationship for the VL through ten maximal isometric contractions at various knee angles. Subjects then cycled on an SRM cycle ergometer at cadences of 50 and 80 revolutions per minute at 100. W, 250. W, and maximal effort. Fascicle lengths were determined at crank angles of 0, 90, and 180?? Fascicles operated at or near the plateau of the maximal force-length relationship for maximal cycling, while operating on the descending limb during sub-maximal conditions for both cadences. However, when comparing the fascicle operating range for the sub-maximal cycling conditions to the corresponding sub-maximal force-length relationships, the VL now also operated across the plateau region. We concluded from these results that regardless of cycling effort, the VL operated through the ideal plateau region of the corresponding force-length relationship, hence always working optimally. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to the coupling of series elastic compliance and length dependent calcium sensitivity in the VL. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hof2003,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the properties of the mechanical system, especially muscle elasticity and limb mass, to a large degree determine force output and movement. This makes the control demands of the central nervous system simpler and more robust. In human triceps surae, a muscle with short fibres and a long tendon, the time courses of the total muscle+tendon length and of the length of the contractile component (CC) alone in running are completely different. The muscle tendon complex shows first an eccentric phase with negative work, followed by a concentric phase. The CC, on the other hand, is concentric all the time. Moreover, the work that is done, is done at a speed that guarantees a high energetic efficiency. It is argued that this high efficiency is an in-built property of the muscle mechanics for muscles with a compliant tendon and a low vmax. When a muscle, or a set of muscles, moves a mass, and the duration of the action is short with respect to the isometric time constant of the muscle, we may call it an 'elastic bounce contraction'. In such a case the mass-spring interaction largely determines the time course of the force, and the efficiency of muscle contraction is most of the time close to optimum. In a similar way, whole limbs can be modelled as springs, with a stiffness that can be modulated by flexing the joints more or less. The motor control task of the central nervous system is simple for such elastic bounce contractions: a block-like activation is sufficient, in which timing is critical, but activation level is not. It seems possible that a whole class of actions can be generated by an identical timing sequence, with only a modulation in activation amplitude. An example is walking or running at different speeds. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The well-known condition for standing stability in static situations is that the vertical projection of the centre of mass (CoM) should be within the base of support (BoS). On the basis of a simple inverted pendulum model, an extension of this rule is proposed for dynamical situations: the position of (the vertical projection of) the CoM plus its velocity times a factor l/g should be within the BoS, l being leg length and g the acceleration of gravity. It is proposed to name this vector quantity 'extrapolated centre of mass position' (XcoM). The definition suggests as a measure of stability the 'margin of stability' b , the minimum distance from XcoM to the boundaries of the BoS. An alternative measure is the temporal stability margin ??, the time in which the boundary of the BoS would be reached without intervention. Some experimental data of subjects standing on one or two feet, flatfoot and tiptoe, are presented to give an idea of the usual ranges of these margins of stability.

abstract = {The force exerted by a muscle is a function of the activation level and the maximum (tetanic) muscle force. In "maximum" voluntary knee extensions muscle activation is lower for eccentric muscle velocities than for concentric velocities. The aim of this study was to model this "differential activation" in order to calculate the maximum voluntary knee extensor torque as a function of knee angular velocity. Torque data were collected on two subjects during maximal eccentric-concentric knee extensions using an isovelocity dynamometer with crank angular velocities ranging from 50 to 450??s-1. The theoretical tetanic torque/angular velocity relationship was modelled using a four parameter function comprising two rectangular hyperbolas while the activation/angular velocity relationship was modelled using a three parameter function that rose from submaximal activation for eccentric velocities to full activation for high concentric velocities. The product of these two functions gave a seven parameter function which was fitted to the joint torque/angular velocity data, giving unbiased root mean square differences of 1.9{\%} and 3.3{\%} of the maximum torques achieved. Differential activation accounts for the non-hyperbolic behaviour of the torque/angular velocity data for low concentric velocities. The maximum voluntary knee extensor torque that can be exerted may be modelled accurately as the product of functions defining the maximum torque and the maximum voluntary activation level. Failure to include differential activation considerations when modelling maximal movements will lead to errors in the estimation of joint torque in the eccentric phase and low velocity concentric phase. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Individual muscle contributions to body segment mechanical energetics and the functional tasks of body support and forward propulsion in walking and running at the same speed were quantified using forward dynamical simulations to elucidate differences in muscle function between the two different gait modes. Simulations that emulated experimentally measured kinesiological data of young adults walking and running at the preferred walk-to-run transition speed revealed that muscles use similar biomechanical mechanisms to provide support and forward propulsion during the two tasks. The primary exception was a decreased contribution of the soleus to forward propulsion in running, which was previously found to be significant in walking. In addition, the soleus distributed its mechanical power differently to individual body segments between the two gait modes from mid- to late stance. In walking, the soleus transferred mechanical energy from the leg to the trunk to provide support, but in running it delivered energy to both the leg and trunk. In running, earlier soleus excitation resulted in it working in synergy with the hip and knee extensors near mid-stance to provide the vertical acceleration for the subsequent flight phase in running. In addition, greater power output was produced by the soleus and hip and knee extensors in running. All other muscle groups distributed mechanical power among the body segments and provided support and forward propulsion in a qualitatively similar manner in both walking and running. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We quantified and compared the kinematics and kinetics of jockeys during gallop riding on a simulator and real horses. Inertial measurement units were attached mid-shaft to the long bones of six jockeys and the sacrum of the horse or simulator. Instrumented stirrups were used to measure force. Data were collected during galloping on a synthetic gallop or while riding a racehorse simulator. Jockey kinematics varied more on a real horse compared to the simulator. Greater than double the peak stirrup force was recorded during gallop on real horses compared to the simulator. On the simulator stirrup forces were symmetrical, whereas on a real horse peak forces were higher on the opposite side to the lead limb. Asymmetric forces and lateral movement of the horse and jockey occurs away from the side of the lead leg, likely a result of horse trunk roll. Jockeys maintained a more upright trunk position on a real horse compared to simulator, with no change in pitch. The feet move in phase with the horse and simulator exhibiting similar magnitude displacements in all directions. In contrast the pelvis was in phase with the horse and simulator in the dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes while a phase shift of 180?? was seen in the cranio-caudal direction indicating an inverted pendulum action of the jockey.},

abstract = {The purposes of this analysis were to predict the feasible movements during which balance can be maintained, based on environmental (contact force), anatomical (foot geometry), and physiological (muscle strength) constraints, and to identify the role of each constraint in limiting movement. An inverted pendulum model with a foot segment was used with an optimization algorithm to determine the set of feasible center of mass (CM) velocity-position combinations for movement termination. The upper boundary of the resulting feasible region ran from a velocity of 1.1 s-1 (normalized to body height) at 2.4 foot lengths behind the heel, to 0.45 s-1 over the heel, to zero over the toe, and the lower boundary from a velocity of 0.9 s-1 at 2.7 foot lengths behind the heel, to zero over the heel. Forward falls would be initiated if states exceeded the upper boundary, and backward falls would be initiated if the states fell below the lower boundary. Under normal conditions, the constraint on the size of the base of support (BOS) determined the upper and lower boundaries of the feasible region. However, friction and strength did limit the feasible region when friction levels were less than 0.82, when dorsiflexion was reduced more than 51{\%}, or when plantar flexion strength was reduced more than 35{\%}. These findings expand the long-held concept that balance is based on CM position limits (i.e. the horizontal CM position has to be confined within the BOS to guarantee stable standing) to a concept based on CM velocity-position limits.},

abstract = {A simulation based on a forward dynamical musculoskeletal model was computed from an optimal control algorithm to understand uni- and bi-articular muscle coordination of maximum-speed startup pedaling. The muscle excitations, pedal reaction forces, and crank and pedal kinematics of the simulation agreed with measurements from subjects. Over the crank cycle, uniarticular hip and knee extensor muscles provide 55{\%} of the propulsive energy, even though 27{\%} of the amount they produce in the downstroke is absorbed in the upstroke. Only 44{\%} of the energy produced by these muscles during downstroke is delivered to the crank directly. The other 56{\%} is delivered to the limb segments, and then transferred to the crank by the ankle plantarflexors. The plantarflexors, especially soleus, also prevent knee hyperextension, by slowing the knee extension being produced during downstroke by the other muscles, including hamstrings. Hamstrings and rectus femoris make smooth pedaling possible by propelling the crank through the stroke transitions. Other simulations showed that pedaling can be performed well by partitioning all the muscles in a leg into two pairs of phase-controlled alternating functional groups, with each group also alternating with its contralateral counterpart. In this scheme, the uniarticular hip/knee extensor muscles (one group) are excited during downstroke, and the uniarticular hip/knee flexor muscles (the alternating group) during upstroke. The ankle dorsiflexor and rectus femoris muscles (one group of the other pair) are excited near the transition from upstroke to downstroke, and the ankle plantarflexors and hamstrings muscles (the alternating group) during the downstroke to upstroke transition. We conclude that these alternating functional muscle groups might represent a centrally generated primitive for not only pedaling but also other locomotor tasks as well.},

abstract = {Computationally advanced biomechanical analyses of gait demonstrate the often counter-intuitive roles of joint moments on various aspects of gait such as propulsion, swing initiation, and balance. Each joint moment can produce linear and angular acceleration of all body segments (including those on which the moment does not directly act) due to the dynamic coupling inherent in the interconnected musculoskeletal system. This study presents quantitative relationships between individual joint moments and trunk control with respect to balance during gait to show that the ankle, knee, and hip joint moments all affect the angular acceleration of the trunk. We show that trunk angular acceleration is affected by all joints in the leg with varying degrees of dependence during the gait cycle. Furthermore, it is shown that inter-planar coupling exists and a two-dimensional analysis of trunk balance neglects important out-of-plane joint moments that affect trunk angular acceleration. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {The force-length-relation (F-l-r) is an important property of skeletal muscle to characterise its function, whereas for in vivo human muscles, torque-angle relationships (T-a-r) represent the maximum muscular capacity as a function of joint angle. However, since in vivo force/torque-length data is only available for rotational single-joint movements the purpose of the present study was to identify torque-angle-relationships for multi-joint leg extension. Therefore, inverse dynamics served for calculation of ankle and knee joint torques of 18 male subjects when performing maximum voluntary isometric contractions in a seated leg press. Measurements in increments of 10?? knee angle from 30?? to 100?? knee flexion resulted in eight discrete angle configurations of hip, knee and ankle joints. For the knee joint we found an ascending-descending T-a-r with a maximum torque of 289.5????43.3. N. m, which closely matches literature data from rotational knee extension. In comparison to literature we observed a shift of optimum knee angle towards knee extension. In contrast, the T-a-r of the ankle joint vastly differed from relationships obtained for isolated plantar flexion. For the ankle T-a-r derived from multi-joint leg extension subjects operated over different sections of the force-length curve, but the ankle T-a-r derived from isolated joint efforts was over the ascending limb for all subjects. Moreover, mean maximum torque of 234.7??56.6. N. m exceeded maximal strength of isolated plantar flexion (185.7??27.8. N. m). From these findings we conclude that muscle function between isolated and more physiological multi-joint tasks differs. This should be considered for ergonomic and sports optimisation as well as for modelling and simulation of human movement. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sloped walking is biomechanically different from level-ground walking, as evidenced by changes in joint kinematics and kinetics. However, the changes in muscle functional roles underlying these altered movement patterns have not been established. In this study, we developed a total of 273 muscle-actuated simulations to assess muscle functional roles, quantified by induced body center-of-mass accelerations and trunk and leg power, during walking on slopes of 0°, ±3°, ±6°, and ±9° at 1.25 m/s. The soleus and gastrocnemius both provided greater forward acceleration of the body parallel to the slope at +9° compared to level ground (+126{\%} and +66{\%}, respectively). However, while the power delivered to the trunk by the soleus varied with slope, the magnitude of net power delivered to the trunk and ipsilateral leg by the biarticular gastrocnemius was similar across all slopes. At +9°, the hip extensors absorbed more power from the trunk (230{\%} hamstrings, 140{\%} gluteus maximus) and generated more power to both legs (200{\%} hamstrings, 160{\%} gluteus maximus) compared to level ground. At −9°, the knee extensors (rectus femoris and vasti) accelerated the body upward perpendicular to the slope at least 50{\%} more and backward parallel to the slope twice as much as on level ground. In addition, the knee extensors absorbed greater amounts of power from the ipsilateral leg on greater declines to control descent. Future studies can use these results to develop targeted rehabilitation programs and assistive devices aimed at restoring sloped walking ability in impaired populations.},

abstract = {Race jockey training is demanding and technical. Increased horse care costs and demands on time have led to greater availability and use of racehorse simulators during training. Little is known about the accuracy of the simulated movement and therefore how effective they are for developing the desired technique. We quantified and compared sacral rotation and displacement vectors for a racehorse simulator and a real galloping horse. A single inertial measurement unit was placed on the sacrum of six horses (horse) during a training gallop along an all-weather seven furlong gallop and on the highest speed setting ???four??? on the simulator. Displacements were calculated in all three axes before being cut into cycles and analysed along with roll and pitch. Displacement and rotation amplitudes were extracted and compared for the horse and simulator. Horse sacral movement parameters were more varied than those recorded on the simulator. The real horse exhibited greater dorso-ventral, medio-lateral and roll amplitude but smaller cranio-caudal displacement amplitude and no difference in pitch amplitude. Displacement trajectory of the simulator when viewed laterally from the left side, was anticlockwise, the opposite direction to that of the real horse leaving the regular use of a simulator during jockey training under question. Use of the racehorse simulator is beneficial to develop specific fitness and to enable physical manipulation into the optimal position. Care must be taken to avoid any detrimental effects of training with the opposite movement trajectory to that experienced during a race. The programming of the simulators may benefit from adaptations to maximise their benefits.},

The purpose of this study was to characterize the management of mechanical energy during cycling and, specifically, to evaluate the potential for system energetic conservatism. Mechanical energy contributions derived from lower extremity energy sources were computed for 12 experienced male cyclists riding at five combinations of cadence and power output. The knee joint dominated ({\textgreater} 50{\%}) in contributing to system energy and a moderate amount of energy was derived from hip joint reaction forces ({\textgreater} 6{\%}). Energy generations and dissipations at the sources were sensitive to power output and, within the range of conditions studied, insensitive to cadence. Two energy models estimated mechanical energy expenditure under hypothetical single-joint and multijoint muscle operating conditions. When multijoint muscles were incorporated into the energy management analysis, a significant reduction in mechanical work relative to the single-joint muscle operation occurred. Energy savings associated with multijoint muscle energy transfers were enhanced at higher bicycle power levels, suggesting that conservation of mechanical energy is plausible given appropriate actions of two-joint muscles.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the effects of moderate-intensity endurance exercise on cycling performance, gross efficiency, and 30-s sprint power output. METHODS: Two separate experiments were conducted. After a controlled warm-up, subjects completed as much work as possible in a 5-min performance test (EXP1) or a maximal 30-s sprint test (EXP2). These initial exercise bouts were followed by approximately 60 min of cycling at approximately 60{\%} VO2peak or an equivalent period of rest (control) before repeating the warm-up exercise and either the 5-min performance or 30-s sprint test. Expired gas for calculation of cycling gross efficiency was collected over the last minute of each warm-up period. RESULTS: Average 5-min performance power output was significantly reduced (12 W) after exercise in EXP1, and in EXP2 both peak and mean power output were significantly lower (26 and 35 W, respectively). Gross efficiency decreased significantly with exercise in both EXP1 and EXP2. Moreover, the change in gross efficiency was correlated with the change in 5-min performance (r = 0.91, P {\textless} 0.01), but not with the change in mean or peak 30-s sprint power output. CONCLUSIONS: After sustained moderate-intensity cycling significant reductions in 5-min performance, gross efficiency and sprint power output were observed in endurance trained cyclists. The reduction in 5-min performance was related to the exercise induced decrease in gross efficiency.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible existence of systematic differences between moment-length properties of the rectus femoris muscle of cyclists/speed skaters and runners. In cycling/speed skating the rectus femoris is used at a shorter length than in running because of the pronounced flexion at the hip joint. It was speculated that using the rectus femoris chronically at different lengths would result in different moment-length relations for the two groups of athletes. Moment-length relations of rectus femoris muscles were determined using an adaptation of procedures outlined in the literature. Four subjects in each group performed 13 isometric knee extensions on a Cybex II dynamometer in each of three testing sessions. Knee and hip angles were varied in a systematic way to allow the determination of moment-length relations over a wide range of normal rectus femoris lengths. It was found that cyclists tended to be stronger at short compared with long rectus femoris lengths, whereas the opposite was true for runners. This finding may be associated with an adaptation of the rectus femoris muscle to the requirements of cycling and running or may show an inherited difference in the muscles of the athletes that existed before they became involved in their respective sports. The data of this study do not allow us to distinguish between these two possible factors.},

abstract = {In this study the function of leg muscles during stretch-shortening cycles in fast running (6 m.s-1) was investigated. For a single stance phase, kinematics, ground reaction forces, and EMG were recorded. First, rough estimates of muscle force, obtained by shifting the EMG curves +90 ms, were correlated with origin-to-insertion velocity (VOI). Second, active state and internal muscle behavior were estimated by using a muscle model that was applied for soleus and gastrocnemius. High correlations were found between estimates of muscle force and VOI time curves for mono-articular hip, knee, and ankle extensor muscles. The correlation coefficients for biarticular muscles were low. The model results showed that active state of gastrocnemius was high during increase of origin-to-insertion length (LOI), whereas active state of soleus was low during the start of increase of LOI and rose to a plateau at the time lengthening ended and shortening started. It seems that the difference in stimulation between gastrocnemius and soleus is a compromise between minimizing energy dissipation and using the stretch-shortening cycle optimally. Furthermore, it was found that the net plantar flexion moment during running reached a value of 302 Nm, which was 158{\%} and 127{\%} higher than the peak values reached in maximal jump and sprint push-offs, respectively. It was argued that the higher mechanical output in running than in jumping could be ascribed to the utilization of the stretch-shortening cycle in running. The higher values in running compared with sprinting, however, may lie in a difference in muscle stimulation.},

abstract = {Purpose: Relationships between tangential pedal force and crank angular velocity in sprint cycling tend to be linear. We set out to understand why they are not hyperbolic, like the intrinsic force-velocity relationship of muscles. Methods: We simulated isokinetic sprint cycling at crank angular velocities ranging from 30 to 150 rpm with a forward dynamic model of the human musculoskeletal system actuated by eight lower extremity muscle groups. Input of the model was muscle stimulation over time, which we optimized to maximize average power output over a cycle. Results: Peak tangential pedal force was found to drop more with crank angular velocity than expected based on intrinsic muscle properties; at 150 rpm it was less than 70{\%} of maximum. This linearizing effect was not due to segmental dynamics but rather to active state dynamics. Maximizing average power in cycling requires muscles to bring their active state from as high as possible during shortening to as low as possible during lengthening. Reducing active state is a relatively slow process, and hence must be initiated a certain amount of time before lengthening starts. As crank angular velocity goes up this amount of time corresponds to a greater angular displacement, so the instant of switching off extensor muscle stimulation must occur earlier relative to the angle at which pedal force was extracted for the force-velocity relationship. Conclusion: Relationships between pedal force and crank angular velocity in sprint cycling do not reflect solely the intrinsic force-velocity relationship of muscles but also consequences of activation dynamics.},

abstract = {PURPOSE This study investigated the effect of knee joint angle and contraction intensity on the co-activation of the hamstring muscles (when acting as antagonists to the quadriceps) in young and older individuals of both sexes. METHODS 25 young (24 ± 2.6 years) and 26 older (70 ± 2.5 years) healthy men and women participated. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the knee extensors (KE) and flexors was assessed at two knee joint angles (90° and 60°, 0° = full extension). At each angle, participants performed submaximal contractions of the KE (20{\%}, 50{\%} and 80{\%} MVIC), while surface electromyography (EMG) was simultaneously acquired from the vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscles to assess the level (EMG RMS) of agonist activation and antagonist co-activation. Subcutaneous adipose tissue in the areas corresponding to surface EMG electrode placements was measured via ultrasonography. RESULTS The contractions performed at 90° knee flexion demonstrated higher levels of antagonist co-activation (all p {\textless} 0.01) and agonist activation (all p {\textless} 0.01) as a function of contraction intensity compared to the 60° knee flexion. Furthermore, after controlling for subcutaneous adipose tissue, older participants exhibited a higher level of antagonist co-activation at 60° knee flexion compared with young participants (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study suggest that (1) the antagonist co-activation is dependent on knee joint angle and contraction intensity; (2) subcutaneous adipose tissue may have an impact on the measured co-activation level likely because of a cross-talk effect. Antagonist co-activation may play a protective role in stabilizing the knee joint and maintaining constant motor output.},

abstract = {Bicycling is a complex sport in which an athlete's energy cost is related to two principal forces: air resistance when traveling on flat terrain, and gravity when traveling uphill. Both wind tunnel data and physiological measurements suggest that air resistance scales as body mass to about the 1/3 power. Thus, large cyclists have only slightly greater frontal drags than small cyclists. If expressed relative to body mass, the frontal drag of small cyclists is considerably greater than that of large cyclists. The difference in frontal drag (energy cost) is not made up for by the advantage to small cyclists in relative VO2max (energy supply), since the mass exponent for drag (1/3) is closer to zero than that for VO2max (2/3). Thus, small cyclists should be at a disadvantage in flat time trials, which field data support. The energy cost of riding uphill slightly favors the large cyclist, because the weight of the bicycle represents a relatively smaller load than it does to a small cyclist. The mass exponent is 0.79. Since this exponent is greater than that for VO2max, the small cyclists have an advantage in climbing, which is supported by field data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe training variations across the annual cycle in Olympic and World Champion endurance athletes, and determine whether these athletes used tapering strategies in line with recommendations in the literature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eleven elite XC skiers and biathletes (4 male; 28±1 yr, 85±5 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) VO2max, 7 female, 25±4 yr, 73±3 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) VO2max) reported one year of day-to-day training leading up to the most successful competition of their career. Training data were divided into periodization and peaking phases and distributed into training forms, intensity zones and endurance activity forms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Athletes trained ∼800 h/500 sessions x year(-1), including ∼500 h x year(-1) of sport-specific training. Ninety-four percent of all training was executed as aerobic endurance training. Of this, ∼90{\%} was low intensity training (LIT, below the first lactate threshold) and 10{\%} high intensity training (HIT, above the first lactate threshold) by time. Categorically, 23{\%} of training sessions were characterized as HIT with primary portions executed at or above the first lactate turn point. Training volume and specificity distribution conformed to a traditional periodization model, but absolute volume of HIT remained stable across phases. However, HIT training patterns tended to become more polarized in the competition phase.

abstract = {Pedaling with independent cranks ensures each leg cycles independently of the other, and thus eliminates the contribution of the contralateral leg during the upstroke phase. Consequently the subject is required to actively pull-up the pedal to complete the cycle. The present study aimed to determine the acute effect of the use of independent cranks on muscle coordination during a submaximal pedaling exercise. Ten healthy males were asked to perform submaximal pedaling exercises at 100 Watts with normal fixed cranks (control condition) or independent cranks. Both 2-D pedal forces and electromyographic (EMG) SIGNALS of 10 lower limb muscles were recorded. When the mean EMG activity across the cycle was considered, the use of independent cranks significantly increased the activity level compared to control for Tibialis anterior (TA) (P = 0.0017; +336 ± 302{\%}), Gastrocnemius medialis (GM) (P = 0.0005; +47 ± 25{\%}), Rectus femoris (RF) (P = 0.005; +123 ± 153{\%}), Biceps femoris (BF)-long head (P = 0.0001; +162 ± 97{\%}), Semimembranosus (SM) (P = 0.0001; +304 ± 192{\%}), and Tensor fascia latae (P = 0.0001; +586 ± 262{\%}). The analysis of the four pedaling sectors revealed that the increased activity of hip and knee flexors mainly occurred during the top dead center and the upstroke phase. In addition, a high inter-individual variability was found in the way the participants adapted to pedaling with independent cranks. The present results showed that the enforced pull-up action required when using independent cranks was achieved by increasing the activation of hip and knee flexors. Further studies are needed to determine whether training with independent cranks has the potential to induce long-term changes in muscle coordination, and, if so, whether these changes are beneficial for cycling performance.},

abstract = {Objective: This study characterized the brain electrical activity during pedaling, a locomotor-like task, in humans. We postulated that phasic brain activity would be associated with active pedaling, consistent with a cortical role in locomotor tasks. Methods: Sixty four channels of electroencephalogram (EEG) and 10 channels of electromyogram (EMG) data were recorded from 10 neurologically-intact volunteers while they performed active and passive (no effort) pedaling on a custom-designed stationary bicycle. Ensemble averaged waveforms, 2 dimensional topographic maps and amplitude of the ?? (13-35. Hz) frequency band were analyzed and compared between active and passive trials. Results: The peak-to-peak amplitude (peak positive-peak negative) of the EEG waveform recorded at the Cz electrode was higher in the passive than the active trials (p{\textless}0.01). ??-band oscillations in electrodes overlying the leg representation area of the cortex were significantly desynchronized during active compared to the passive pedaling (p{\textless}0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between the average EEG waveform for active trials and the composite EMG (summated EMG from both limbs for each muscle) of the rectus femoris (r=-0.77, p{\textless}0.01) the medial hamstrings (r=-0.85, p{\textless}0.01) and the tibialis anterior (r=-0.70, p{\textless}0.01) muscles. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that substantial sensorimotor processing occurs in the brain during pedaling in humans. Further, cortical activity seemed to be greatest during recruitment of the muscles critical for transitioning the legs from flexion to extension and vice versa. Significance: This is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of EEG recording during pedaling, and owing to similarities between pedaling and bipedal walking, may provide valuable insight into brain activity during locomotion in humans. ?? 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

Surface electromyography was used to record the electrical activity of tibialis anterior, soleus, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, and gluteus maximus. There were no differences (P{\textgreater}. 0.05) in the muscle activity onset and offset or in the iEMG of any muscles between visits. There were also no differences (P{\textgreater}. 0.05) between cyclists and non-cyclists in the variability of these parameters. Overall, standard error of measurement (SEM) and intra-class correlation analyses suggested similar reliability of both inter- and intra-session muscle activity onset and offset. The SEM of activity onset in tibialis anterior and activity offset in soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis and rectus femoris was markedly higher than in the other muscles. Intra-session iEMG was reliable (coefficient of variation (CV) = 5.3-13.5{\%}, across all muscles), though a CV range of 15.8-43.1{\%} identified low inter-session iEMG reliability. During submaximal cycling, the temporal components of muscle activity exhibit similar intra- and inter-session reliability.

abstract = {On the bicycle, the human upper extremity has two essential functions in steering the bicycle and in supporting the body. Through the handlebar, surface-induced loads are transmitted to the hand and arm of the bicycle rider under vibration exposure conditions. Thus, the purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of vibration exposure on forearm muscle activity for different road surfaces (i.e. smooth road, concrete stone pave-ment, rough road) and for different bicycles. Ten subjects par-ticipated in experiments and two types of bicycles, i.e. Road Bike (RB) and Mountain Bike (MTB) are compared. The accel-eration magnitudes were dominant along x and z-axes. The r.m.s acceleration values in the z direction at the stem of MTB were at most 2.56, 7.04 and 10.76 m{\textperiodcentered}s -2 when pedaling respectively on asphalt road, concrete pavement and rough road. In the case of RB the corresponding values were respectively 4.43, 11.75 and 27.31 m{\textperiodcentered}s -2 . The cumulative normalized muscular activity levels during MTB trials on different surfaces had the same tendency as with acceleration amplitudes and have ranked in the same order from lowest to highest value. Although road bike meas-urements have resulted in a similar trend of increment, the val-ues computed for rough road trials were higher than those in MTB trials. During rough road measurements on MTB, rmsEMG of extensor muscles reached a value corresponding to approximately 50{\%} of MVC (Maximum Voluntary Contrac-tion). During RB trials performed on rough road conditions, rmsEMG ({\%}MVC) values for the forearm flexor muscles reached 45.8{\%} of their maximal. The level of muscular activity of forearm muscles in controlling handlebar movements has been observed to be enhanced by the increase in the level of vibration exposed on the bicycle. Since repeated forceful grip-ping and pushing forces to a handle of a vibratory tool can cre-ate a risk of developing circulatory, neurological, or muscu-loskeletal disorder, a bicycle rider can be considered vulnerable to developing vibration related overuse injuries and/or perform-ance diminishing consequences.},

abstract = {Development of robotic exoskeletons to assist/enhance human locomotor performance involves lengthy prototyping, testing, and analysis. This process is further convoluted by variability in limb/body morphology and preferred gait patterns between individuals. In an attempt to expedite this process, and establish a physiological basis for actuator prescription, we developed a simple, predictive model of human neuromechanical adaptation to a passive elastic exoskeleton applied at the ankle joint during a functional task. We modeled the human triceps surae-Achilles tendon muscle tendon unit (MTU) as a single Hill-type muscle, or contractile element (CE), and series tendon, or series elastic element (SEE). This modeled system was placed under gravitational load and underwent cyclic stimulation at a regular frequency (i.e. hopping) with and without exoskeleton (Exo) assistance. We explored the effect that both Exo stiffness [Formula: see text] and muscle activation [Formula: see text] had on combined MTU and Exo (MTU + Exo), MTU, and CE/SEE mechanics and energetics. Model accuracy was verified via qualitative and quantitative comparisons between modeled and prior experimental outcomes. We demonstrated that reduced [Formula: see text] can be traded for increased [Formula: see text] to maintain consistent MTU + Exo mechanics (i.e. average positive power [Formula: see text] output) from an unassisted condition (i.e. [Formula: see text]). For these regions of parameter space, our model predicted a reduction in MTU force, SEE energy cycling, and metabolic rate [Formula: see text], as well as constant CE [Formula: see text] output compared to unassisted conditions. This agreed with previous experimental observations, demonstrating our model's predictive ability. Model predictions also provided insight into mechanisms of metabolic cost minimization, and/or enhanced mechanical performance, and we concluded that both of these outcomes cannot be achieved simultaneously, and that one must come at the detriment of the other in a spring-assisted compliant MTU.},

The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) suggests estimating human {\_}Vo2 during exercise on a cycle ergometer through an equation that considers individual's body mass and external work rate, but not pedaling rate (PR). We hypothesized that including PR in the ACSM equation would improve its {\_}Vo2 prediction accuracy. Ten healthy male participants' (age 19–48 years) were recruited and their steady-state {\_}Vo2 was recorded on a cycle ergometer for 16 combinations of external work rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 W) and PR (50, 70, 90, and 110 revolutions per minute). {\_}Vo2 was calculated by means of a new equation, and by the ACSM equation for comparison. Kinematic data were collected by means of an infrared 3-D motion analysis system in order to explore the mechanical determinants of {\_}Vo2. Including PR in the ACSM equation improved the accuracy for prediction of sub-maximal {\_}Vo2 during exercise (mean bias 1.9 vs. 3.3 mL O2 kg?1 min?1) but it did not affect the accuracy for prediction of maximal {\_}Vo2 (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Confirming the validity of this new equation, the results were replicated for data reported in the literature in 51 participants.

abstract = {Here we report on the effect of combining endurance training with heavy or explosive strength training on endurance performance in endurance-trained runners and cyclists. Running economy is improved by performing combined endurance training with either heavy or explosive strength training. However, heavy strength training is recommended for improving cycling economy. Equivocal findings exist regarding the effects on power output or velocity at the lactate threshold. Concurrent endurance and heavy strength training can increase running speed and power output at VO2max (Vmax and Wmax , respectively) or time to exhaustion at Vmax and Wmax . Combining endurance training with either explosive or heavy strength training can improve running performance, while there is most compelling evidence of an additive effect on cycling performance when heavy strength training is used. It is suggested that the improved endurance performance may relate to delayed activation of less efficient type II fibers, improved neuromuscular efficiency, conversion of fast-twitch type IIX fibers into more fatigue-resistant type IIA fibers, or improved musculo-tendinous stiffness.},

However, there is no consensus on what method should be used to measure the knee angle. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to compare three dynamic methods to each other and against a static method. The second aim was to test the intra-session reliability of the knee angle at BDC measured by dynamic methods. Eleven cyclists performed five 3-min cycling trials; three at different seat heights (25°, 30° and 35° knee angle at BDC according to static measure) and two at preferred seat height. Thirteen infrared cameras (3D), a high-speed camera (2D), and an electrogoniometer were used to measure the knee angle during pedalling, when the pedal was at the BDC. Compared to 3D kinematics, all other methods statistically significantly underestimated the knee angle (P = 0.00; $\eta$(2) = 0.73). All three dynamic methods have been found to be substantially different compared to the static measure (effect sizes between 0.4 and 0.6). All dynamic methods achieved good intra-session reliability. 2D kinematics is a valid tool for knee angle assessment during bike fitting. However, for higher precision, one should use correction factor by adding 2.2° to the measured value.},

This was achieved by applying pedalling as a movement model and exposing healthy and recreationally active individuals as well as trained cyclists to for example cardiopulmonary and mechanical loading, fatiguing exercise, and heavy strength training. As a part of the background, the effect of pedalling frequency on diverse relevant biomechanical, physiological, and psychophysiological variables as well as on performance was initially explored. Freely chosen pedalling frequency is considerably higher than the energetically optimal pedalling frequency. This has been shown by others and was confirmed in the present work. As a result, pedal force is relatively low while rates of VO2 and energy turnover are relatively high during freely chosen pedalling as compared to a condition where a lower and more efficient pedalling frequency is imposed. The freely chosen pedalling frequency was in the present work, and by others, found to most likely be less advantageous than the lower energetically optimal pedalling frequency with respect to performance during intensive cycling following prolonged submaximal cycling. This stimulates the motivation to understand the behaviour and control of the freely chosen pedalling frequency during cycling. Freely chosen pedalling frequency was in the present work shown to be highly individual. In addition, the pedalling frequency was shown to be steady in a longitudinal perspective across 12 weeks. Further, it was shown to be unaffected by both fatiguing hip extension exercise and hip flexion exercise as well as by increased loading on the cardiopulmonary system at constant mechanical loading, and vice versa. Based on this, the freely chosen pedalling frequency is considered to be characterised as a highly individual, steady, and robust innate voluntary motor rhythm under primary influence of central pattern generators. The last part of the characterisation is largely based on, and supported by, work of other researchers in the field. Despite the robustness of the freely chosen pedalling frequency, it may be affected by some particular factors. As an example from the present work, freely chosen pedalling frequency during treadmill cycling increased by on average 15 to 17 rpm when power output was increased from a value corresponding to 86{\%} and up to 165{\%} of Wmax . This phenomenon is supported by other studies. As another example from the present work, freely chosen pedalling frequency decreased by on average 9 to 14 rpm following heavy strength training that involved both hip extension and hip flexion. Further, the present work suggested that the latter phenomenon occurred within the first week of training and was caused by in particular the hip extension strength training rather than the hip flexion strength training. The fast response to the strength training indicated that neural adaptations presumably caused the observed changes in movement behaviour. The internal organisation of the central pattern generator is by some other researchers in the field considered to be functionally separated into two components, in which, one is responsible for movement frequency and another is responsible for movement pattern. For the present dissertation, the freely chosen pedalling frequency was considered to reflect the rhythmic movement frequency of the voluntary rhythmic leg movement of pedalling. The tangential pedal force profile was considered to reflect the rhythmic movement pattern. The present work showed that fatiguing hip flexion exercise in healthy and recreationally active individuals modified the tangential pedal force profile during cycling at a pre-set target pedalling frequency in a way that the minimum tangential pedal force became more negative, the maximum tangential pedal force increased, and the phase with negative tangential pedal force increased. In other words, the legs were "actively lifted" to a lesser extent in the upstroke phase. Fatiguing hip extension exercise did not have that effect. And none of the fatiguing exercises affected the freely chosen pedalling frequency. The present work furthermore showed that the primary effect of hip extension strength training was that it decreased the freely chosen pedalling frequency. An interpretation of this could be that the hip extension strength training, in particular, influenced the output from the component of the central pattern generator that may be responsible for rhythmic movement frequency},

abstract = {Objectives: To examine the effects of cycling at preferred, forward and backward saddle positions on patellofemoral compressive and tibiofemoral compressive and shear forces. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: An incremental cycling test to exhaustion determined cyclists' maximal aerobic workload and second ventilatory threshold. In a second session, 1-min cycling trial at maximal aerobic workload then three 2-min trials at second ventilatory threshold workload at preferred, forward and backward saddle positions. Right pedal force via instrumented pedals, lower limb joint kinematics via video and inverse dynamics were used to calculate knee joint forces. Participants: Twenty-one competitive cyclists (28 ?? 7 years). Main outcome measures: Patellofemoral compressive, tibiofemoral compressive and shear forces, and knee flexion angle. Results: Changes to forward/backward saddle positions did not substantially affect compressive forces for patellofemoral (1-4{\%}) or tibiofemoral (1-3{\%}) joints. Tibiofemoral shear force increased in backward compared with preferred (19{\%}) or forward (26{\%}) saddle positions. Knee flexion angle at 3 o'clock (22{\%}) and 6 o'clock crank positions (36{\%}) increased at the forward compared to the backward saddle position. Conclusions: Small increases in knee flexion angle (5-6??) explained trivial differences in patellofemoral and tibiofemoral compressive forces. Tibiofemoral shear force may be more sensitive to changes in knee joint angle compared to other knee force components. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To reduce aerodynamic resistance cyclists lower their torso angle, concurrently reducing Peak Power Output (PPO). However, realistic torso angle changes in the range used by time trial cyclists have not yet been examined. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of torso angle on physiological parameters and frontal area in different commonly used time trial positions. Nineteen well-trained male cyclists performed incremental tests on a cycle ergometer at five different torso angles: their preferred torso angle and at 0, 8, 16 and 24°. Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide expiration, minute ventilation, gross efficiency, PPO, heart rate, cadence and frontal area were recorded. The frontal area provides an estimate of the aerodynamic drag. Overall, results showed that lower torso angles attenuated performance. Maximal values of all variables, attained in the incremental test, decreased with lower torso angles (P {\textless} 0.001). The 0° torso angle position significantly affected the metabolic and physiological variables compared to all other investigated positions. At constant submaximal intensities of 60, 70 and 80{\%} PPO, all variables significantly increased with increasing intensity (P {\textless} 0.0001) and decreasing torso angle (P {\textless} 0.005). This study shows that for trained cyclists there should be a trade-off between the aerodynamic drag and physiological functioning.},

abstract = {A growing body of research on the mechanics and energetics of terrestrial locomotion has demonstrated that elastic elements acting in series with contracting muscle are critical components of sustained, stable and efficient gait. Far fewer studies have examined how the nervous system modulates muscle-tendon interaction dynamics to optimize 'tuning' or meet varying locomotor demands. To explore the fundamental neuromechanical rules that govern the interactions between series elastic elements (SEEs) and contractile elements (CEs) within a compliant muscle-tendon unit (MTU), we used a novel work loop approach that included implanted sonomicrometry crystals along muscle fascicles. This enabled us to decouple CE and SEE length trajectories when cyclic strain patterns were applied to an isolated plantaris MTU from the bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus). Using this approach, we demonstrate that the onset timing of muscle stimulation (i.e. stimulation phase) that involves a symmetrical MTU stretch-shorten cycle during active force production results in net zero mechanical power output, and maximal decoupling of CE and MTU length trajectories. We found it difficult to 'tune' the muscle-tendon system for strut-like isometric force production by adjusting stimulation phase only, as the zero power output condition involved significant positive and negative mechanical work by the CE. A simple neural mechanism - adjusting muscle stimulation phase - could shift an MTU from performing net zero to net positive (energy producing) or net negative (energy absorbing) mechanical work under conditions of changing locomotor demand. Finally, we show that modifications to the classical work loop paradigm better represent in vivo muscle-tendon function during locomotion.},

abstract = {Finding an optimum for the cycling performance is not a trivial matter, since the literature shows the presence of many controversial aspects. In order to quantify different levels of performance, several indexes have been defined and used in many studies, reflecting variations in physiological and biomechanical factors. In particular, indexes such as Gross Efficiency (GE), Net Efficiency (NE) and Delta Efficiency (DE) have been referred to changes in metabolic efficiency (EffMet), while the Indexes of Effectiveness (IE), defined over the complete crank revolution or over part of it, have been referred to variations in mechanical effectiveness (EffMech). All these indicators quantify the variations of different factors [i.e., muscle fibers type distribution, pedaling cadence, setup of the bicycle frame, muscular fatigue (MFat), environmental variables, ergogenic aids, psychological traits (PsychTr)], which, moreover, show high mutual correlation. In the attempt of assessing cycling performance, most studies in the literature keep all these factors separated. This may bring to misleading results, leaving unanswered the question of how to improve cycling performance. This work provides an overview on the studies involving indexes and factors usually related to performance monitoring and assessment in cycling. In particular, in order to clarify all those aspects, the mutual interactions among these factors are highlighted, in view of a global performance assessment. Moreover, a proposal is presented advocating for a model-based approach that considers all factors mentioned in the survey, including the mutual interaction effects, for the definition of an objective function E representing the overall effectiveness of a training program in terms of both EffMet and EffMech.},

abstract = {Muscle force production occurs within an environment of tissues that exhibit spring-like behavior, and this elasticity is a critical determinant of muscle performance during locomotion. Muscle force and power output both depend on the speed of contraction, as described by the isotonic force-velocity curve. By influencing the speed of contractile elements, elastic structures can have a profound effect on muscle force, power and work. In very rapid movements, elastic mechanisms can amplify muscle power by storing the work of muscle contraction slowly and releasing it rapidly. When energy must be dissipated rapidly, such as in landing from a jump, energy stored rapidly in elastic elements can be released more slowly to stretch muscle contractile elements, reducing the power input to muscle and possibly protecting it from damage. Elastic mechanisms identified so far rely primarily on in-series tendons, but many structures within muscles exhibit spring-like properties. Actomyosin cross-bridges, actin and myosin filaments, titin, and the connective tissue scaffolding of the extracellular matrix all have the potential to store and recover elastic energy during muscle contraction. The potential contribution of these elements can be assessed from their stiffness and estimates of the strain they undergo during muscle function. Such calculations provide boundaries for the possible roles these springs might play in locomotion, and may help to direct future studies of the uses of elastic elements in muscle.},

METHODS Seventeen recreationally active cyclists performed 6 stages of constant load cycling using cadences of 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 rpm. Joint specific power was calculated using inverse dynamics and mVO2 and oxygenation were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS Increasing cadence led to increased knee joint power and decreased hip joint power while the ankle joint was unaffected. Increasing cadence also led to an increased deoxygenation in both the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. Vastus lateralis mVO2 increased when cadence was increased. No effect of cadence was found for vastus medialis mVO2. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates a different effect of cadence on the mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. The combined mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and medialis showed a linear increase with increasing knee joint specific power, demonstrating that the muscles combined related to power generated over the joint.},

abstract = {The aerodynamic drag of a cyclist in time trial (TT) position is strongly influenced by the torso angle. While decreasing the torso angle reduces the drag, it limits the physiological functioning of the cyclist. Therefore the aims of this study were to predict the optimal TT cycling position as function of the cycling speed and to determine at which speed the aerodynamic power losses start to dominate. Two models were developed to determine the optimal torso angle: a 'Metabolic Energy Model' and a 'Power Output Model'. The Metabolic Energy Model minimised the required cycling energy expenditure, while the Power Output Model maximised the cyclists[U+05F3] power output. The input parameters were experimentally collected from 19 TT cyclists at different torso angle positions (0-24°). The results showed that for both models, the optimal torso angle depends strongly on the cycling speed, with decreasing torso angles at increasing speeds. The aerodynamic losses outweigh the power losses at cycling speeds above 46. km/h. However, a fully horizontal torso is not optimal. For speeds below 30. km/h, it is beneficial to ride in a more upright TT position. The two model outputs were not completely similar, due to the different model approaches. The Metabolic Energy Model could be applied for endurance events, while the Power Output Model is more suitable in sprinting or in variable conditions (wind, undulating course, etc.). It is suggested that despite some limitations, the models give valuable information about improving the cycling performance by optimising the TT cycling position. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aims of the present study were both to describe anthropometrics and cycling power-velocity characteristics in top-level track sprinters, and to test the hypothesis that these variables would represent interesting predictors of the 200 m track sprint cycling performance. Twelve elite cyclists volunteered to perform a torque-velocity test on a calibrated cycle ergometer, after the measurement of their lean leg volume (LLV) and frontal surface area (A(p)), in order to draw torque- and power-velocity relationships, and to evaluate the maximal power (P(max)), and both the optimal pedalling rate (f(opt)) and torque (T(opt)) at which P (max) is reached. The 200 m performances--i.e. velocity (V200) and pedalling rate (f 200)--were measured during international events (REC) and in the 2002 French Track Cycling Championships (NAT). P(max), f(opt), and T(opt) were respectively 1600 +/- 116 W, 129.8 +/- 4.7 rpm and 118.5 +/- 9.8 N . m. P(max) was strongly correlated with T(opt) (p {\textless} 0.001), which was correlated with LLV (p {\textless} 0.01). V200 was related to P(max) normalized by A(p) (p {\textless} or = 0.05) and also to f(opt) (p {\textless} 0.01) for REC and NAT. f 200 (155.2 +/- 3, REC; 149 +/- 4.3, NAT) were significantly higher than f(opt) (p {\textless} 0.001). These findings demonstrated that, in this population of world-class track cyclists, the optimization of the ratio between P(max) and A(p) represents a key factor of 200 m performance. Concerning the major role also played by f(opt), it is assumed that, considering high values of f 200, sprinters with a high value of optimal pedalling rate (i.e. lower f200-f(opt) difference) could be theoretically in better conditions to maximize their power output during the race and hence performance.},

abstract = {A group of coexcited muscles alternating with another group is a common element of motor control, including locomotor pattern generation. This study used computer simulation to investigate human pedaling with each muscle assigned at times to a group. Simulations were generated by applying patterns of muscle excitations to a musculoskeletal model that includes the dynamic properties of the muscles, the limb segments, and the crank load. Raasch et al. showed that electromyograms, pedal reaction forces, and limb and crank kinematics recorded during maximum-speed start-up pedaling could be replicated with two signals controlling the excitation of four muscle groups (1 group alternating with another to form a pair). Here a four-muscle-group control also is shown to replicate steady pedaling. However, simulations show that three signals controlling six muscle groups (i.e., 3 pairs) is much more biomechanically robust, such that a wide variety of forward and backward pedaling tasks can be executed well. We found the biomechanical functions necessary for pedaling, and how these functions can be executed by the muscle groups. Specifically, the phasing of two pairs with respect to limb extension and flexion and the transitions between extension and flexion do not change with pedaling direction. One pair of groups (uniarticular hip and knee extensors alternating with their anatomic antagonists) generates the energy required for limb and crank propulsion during limb extension and flexion, respectively. In the second pair, the ankle plantarflexors transfer the energy from the limb inertia to the crank during the latter part of limb extension and the subsequent limb extension-to-flexion transition. The dorsiflexors alternate with the plantarflexors. The phasing of the third pair (the biarticular thigh muscles) reverses with pedaling direction. In forward pedaling, the hamstring is excited during the extension-to-flexion transition and in backward pedaling during the opposite transition. In both cases hamstrings propel the crank posteriorly through the transition. Rectus femoris alternates with hamstrings and propels the crank anteriorly through the transitions. With three control signals, one for each pair of groups, different cadences (or power outputs) can be achieved by adjusting the overall excitatory drive to the pattern generating elements, and different pedaling goals (e.g., smooth, or energy-efficient pedaling; 1- or 2-legged pedaling) by adjusting the relative excitation levels among the muscle groups. These six muscle groups are suggested to be elements of a general strategy for pedaling control, which may be generally applicable to other human locomotor tasks.},

The head, arms, and torso (HAT) are modeled as a single rigid body. The HAT articulates with the pelvis via a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint. Each hip is modeled as a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint, and each knee is modeled as a 1 dof hinge joint. Each foot is represented by a hindfoot and toes segment. The hindfoot articulates with the shank via a 2 dof universal joint, and the toes articulate with the hindfoot via a 1 dof hinge joint. Interaction of the feet with the ground is modeled using a series of spring-damper units placed under the sole of each foot. The path of each muscle is represented by either a series of straight lines or a combination of straight lines and space curves. Each actuator is modeled as a three-element, Hill-type muscle in series with tendon. A first-order process is assumed to model muscle excitation-contraction dynamics. Dynamic optimization theory is used to calculate the pattern of muscle excitations that produces a maximal vertical jump. Quantitative comparisons between model and experiment indicate that the model reproduces the kinematic, kinetic, and muscle-coordination patterns evident when humans jump to their maximum achievable heights.},

abstract = {Today, there are many people who enjoy jogging in a regular basis. Many of them uses wearable devices to log their running time, route, etc. To improve running performance, it is important to assess running qualitatively as well. However, these devices do not assess quality of running, and do not teach users what to change and how to change in order to improve quality of running. The purpose of this study is to present correlation between pelvic rotation and running performance, experimentally, and discuss how indices can be designed to assess quality of running. For the experiment, 60 student athletes participated and run 1500 meter for two times with an accelerometer and gyro meter sensor attached to their lower back. The result shows that there is a correlation between pelvic rotation and running performance. Followed by discussion for designing the indices of running quality. INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, increasing number of people are interested in maintaining good health condition and many of them are enjoying taking a jog on a regular basis. Furthermore, good portion of them are utilizing wearable or portable devices, such as smartphones or smart watches, with embedded sensors to maximize their experiences by logging their activities. The logs, in general, are results of taking advantage of data set from GPS and accelerometer. They provide users with status of running time, distances, route, burned calories, and so on. However, these status do not tell what to change or/and how to change, in order to improve users' performance of running. This is mainly because that these devices, in general, are limited in measuring body motions while users are running. It would be beneficial for those runners if there is a means to measure body motions during a jog and a way to suggest what to do and how to do for improvement of the performance. Sensor technology has been used to study walking gait and knee joint angle studies (Kawano, Kobashi, Yagi, Kondo, Yoshiya {\&} Hata, 2007), however, studies of running using portable sensors are relatively sparse (Fong {\&} Chan, 2010). In addition, researches on performance of running with respect to rotational activity of the pelvis is relatively sparse as well (Hamner, Seth {\&} Delp, 2010). To improve users' running performance, it is needed to assess quality of running, and to designe indices. Therefore, as a first step toward achieving this, we hypothesize that rotational activity of the pelvis around body axis has correlation with running quality. The purpose of this study was to identify whether the hypothesize is correct and examine whether it can be used as a index. This index would be beneficial not only for regular joggers but also for athletes to assess quaily of their running promptly, using portable devices.},

abstract = {High-intensity interval training (HIT) is a well-known, time-efficient training method for improving cardiorespiratory and metabolic function and, in turn, physical performance in athletes. HIT involves repeated short ({\textless}45 s) to long (2-4 min) bouts of rather high-intensity exercise interspersed with recovery periods (refer to the previously published first part of this review). While athletes have used 'classical' HIT formats for nearly a century (e.g. repetitions of 30 s of exercise interspersed with 30 s of rest, or 2-4-min interval repetitions ran at high but still submaximal intensities), there is today a surge of research interest focused on examining the effects of short sprints and all-out efforts, both in the field and in the laboratory. Prescription of HIT consists of the manipulation of at least nine variables (e.g. work interval intensity and duration, relief interval intensity and duration, exercise modality, number of repetitions, number of series, between-series recovery duration and intensity); any of which has a likely effect on the acute physiological response. Manipulating HIT appropriately is important, not only with respect to the expected middle- to long-term physiological and performance adaptations, but also to maximize daily and/or weekly training periodization. Cardiopulmonary responses are typically the first variables to consider when programming HIT (refer to Part I). However, anaerobic glycolytic energy contribution and neuromuscular load should also be considered to maximize the training outcome. Contrasting HIT formats that elicit similar (and maximal) cardiorespiratory responses have been associated with distinctly different anaerobic energy contributions. The high locomotor speed/power requirements of HIT (i.e. ≥95 {\%} of the minimal velocity/power that elicits maximal oxygen uptake [v/p({\textperiodcentered})VO(2max)] to 100 {\%} of maximal sprinting speed or power) and the accumulation of high-training volumes at high-exercise intensity (runners can cover up to 6-8 km at v({\textperiodcentered})VO(2max) per session) can cause significant strain on the neuromuscular/musculoskeletal system. For athletes training twice a day, and/or in team sport players training a number of metabolic and neuromuscular systems within a weekly microcycle, this added physiological strain should be considered in light of the other physical and technical/tactical sessions, so as to avoid overload and optimize adaptation (i.e. maximize a given training stimulus and minimize musculoskeletal pain and/or injury risk). In this part of the review, the different aspects of HIT programming are discussed, from work/relief interval manipulation to HIT periodization, using different examples of training cycles from different sports, with continued reference to the cardiorespiratory adaptations outlined in Part I, as well as to anaerobic glycolytic contribution and neuromuscular/musculoskeletal load.},

abstract = {While the physiological adaptations that occur following endurance training in previously sedentary and recreationally active individuals are relatively well understood, the adaptations to training in already highly trained endurance athletes remain unclear. While significant improvements in endurance performance and corresponding physiological markers are evident following submaximal endurance training in sedentary and recreationally active groups, an additional increase in submaximal training (i.e. volume) in highly trained individuals does not appear to further enhance either endurance performance or associated physiological variables [e.g. peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), oxidative enzyme activity]. It seems that, for athletes who are already trained, improvements in endurance performance can be achieved only through high-intensity interval training (HIT). The limited research which has examined changes in muscle enzyme activity in highly trained athletes, following HIT, has revealed no change in oxidative or glycolytic enzyme activity, despite significant improvements in endurance performance (p {\textless} 0.05). Instead, an increase in skeletal muscle buffering capacity may be one mechanism responsible for an improvement in endurance performance. Changes in plasma volume, stroke volume, as well as muscle cation pumps, myoglobin, capillary density and fibre type characteristics have yet to be investigated in response to HIT with the highly trained athlete. Information relating to HIT programme optimisation in endurance athletes is also very sparse. Preliminary work using the velocity at which VO2max is achieved (V(max)) as the interval intensity, and fractions (50 to 75{\%}) of the time to exhaustion at V(max) (T(max)) as the interval duration has been successful in eliciting improvements in performance in long-distance runners. However, V(max) and T(max) have not been used with cyclists. Instead, HIT programme optimisation research in cyclists has revealed that repeated supramaximal sprinting may be equally effective as more traditional HIT programmes for eliciting improvements in endurance performance. Further examination of the biochemical and physiological adaptations which accompany different HIT programmes, as well as investigation into the optimal HIT programme for eliciting performance enhancements in highly trained athletes is required.},

The standard error between the modeled and measured power (2.7 W) was very small. The model was also used to estimate the effects of changes in several model parameters on cycling velocity.

abstract = {High-intensity interval training (HIT), in a variety of forms, is today one of the most effective means of improving cardiorespiratory and metabolic function and, in turn, the physical performance of athletes. HIT involves repeated short-to-long bouts of rather high-intensity exercise interspersed with recovery periods. For team and racquet sport players, the inclusion of sprints and all-out efforts into HIT programmes has also been shown to be an effective practice. It is believed that an optimal stimulus to elicit both maximal cardiovascular and peripheral adaptations is one where athletes spend at least several minutes per session in their 'red zone,' which generally means reaching at least 90{\%} of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). While use of HIT is not the only approach to improve physiological parameters and performance, there has been a growth in interest by the sport science community for characterizing training protocols that allow athletes to maintain long periods of time above 90{\%} of VO2max (T@VO2max). In addition to T@VO2max, other physiological variables should also be considered to fully characterize the training stimulus when programming HIT, including cardiovascular work, anaerobic glycolytic energy contribution and acute neuromuscular load and musculoskeletal strain. Prescription for HIT consists of the manipulation of up to nine variables, which include the work interval intensity and duration, relief interval intensity and duration, exercise modality, number of repetitions, number of series, as well as the between-series recovery duration and intensity. The manipulation of any of these variables can affect the acute physiological responses to HIT. This article is Part I of a subsequent II-part review and will discuss the different aspects of HIT programming, from work/relief interval manipulation to the selection of exercise mode, using different examples of training cycles from different sports, with continued reference to T@VO2max and cardiovascular responses. Additional programming and periodization considerations will also be discussed with respect to other variables such as anaerobic glycolytic system contribution (as inferred from blood lactate accumulation), neuromuscular load and musculoskeletal strain (Part II).},

abstract = {The goal of this research was to examine the accuracy of three methods used to indicate the hip joint center (HJC) in seated steady-state cycling. Two of the methods have been used in previous studies of cycling biomechanics and included tracking a marker placed over the superior aspect of the greater trochanter, a location that estimates the center of rotation of the hip joint, and assuming that the hip is fixed. The third method was new and utilized an anthropometric relationship to determine the hip joint location from a marker placed over the anterior-superior iliac spine. To perform a comparative analysis of errors inherent in the three methods, a standard method which located the true hip joint center was developed. The standard method involved establishing a pelvis-fixed coordinate system using a triad of video markers attached to an intracortical pin. Three- dimensional motion analysis quantified the true hip joint center position coordinates. To provide data for the comparative analysis, the intracortical pin was anchored to a single subject who pedaled at nine cadence-workrate combinations while data for all four methods were simultaneously recorded. At all cadence-workrate combinations the new method was more accurate than the trochanter method with movement errors lower by a factor of 2 in the vertical direction and a factor of 3 in the horizontal direction. Relative to the errors introduced by the fixed hip assumption, the new method was also generally more accurate by at least a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction and had comparable accuracy in the vertical direction. For computed kinetic quantities, the new method most accurately indicated hip joint force power but the fixed hip method most accurately indicated the work produced by the hip joint force over the crank cycle.},

abstract = {To provide a scientific basis for the design of bicycle pedals which possibly alleviate over-use knee injuries, two hypotheses were tested in the present study. The two hypotheses were: (1) that the three-dimensional pedal constraint loads; and (2) that the three-dimensional intersegmental knee loads would be reduced more significantly by a foot/pedal platform allowing both adduction/abduction and inversion/eversion rotations simultaneously than by a platform which allowed either rotation individually. To test these hypotheses, pedal load and lower limb kinematic data were collected from 10 subjects who pedaled with four pedal platforms which allowed zero, one, and two degrees of freedom. A number of quantities describing both pedal loads and intersegmental knee loads was computed for each of the four pedal platforms using a previously reported biomechanical model. The quantities included the positive and negative extremes, averages, and areas, as well as the total absolute area and RMS. Quantities were compared using analysis of variance techniques. The key results were that there were significant reductions in the coupled nondriving moments at the pedal for the dual-rotation platform compared to each of the single-rotation cases. The significant reductions in the coupled moments at the pedal were not manifest at the knee. However, a general nonsignificant reduction in both coupled knee moments was evident. Also, the valgus knee moment was significantly reduced by the dual-rotation platform compared to the inversion/eversion only design. Although the axial knee moment was not significantly reduced by the dual-rotation platform over the adduction/abduction design, there was a general nonsignificant reduction. The lack of significance in knee load results occurred because of high intersubject variability. Accordingly, load reduction benefits made by introducing the second degree of freedom need to be considered individually.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that the sum of the absolute changes in mechanical energy (internal work) is correlated with the muscular mechanical energy expenditure (MMEE) was tested using two elliptical chainrings, one that reduced and one that increased the internal work (compared to circular). Upper and lower bounds were put on the extra MMEE (work done by net joint torques in excess of the external work) with respect to the effect of intercompensation between joint torques due to biarticular muscles. This was done by having two measures of MMEE, one that allowed no intercompensation and one that allowed complete intercompensation between joints spanned by biarticular muscles. Energy analysis showed no correlation between internal work and the two measures of MMEE. When compared to circular, the chainring that reduced internal work increased MMEE, and phases of increased crank velocity associated with the elliptical shape resulted in increased power absorbed by the upstroke leg as it was accelerated against gravity. The resulting negative work necessitated additional positive work. Thus, the hypothesis that the internal work is correlated with MMEE was found to be invalid, and the total mechanical work done cannot be estimated by summing the internal and external work. Changes in the dynamics of cycling caused by a non-circular chainring may affect performance and must be considered during the non-circular chainring design process. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to assess the utility of experimental methods to quantify mechanical energy expenditure (MEE) in human movement. To achieve this goal, a theoretical model of steady-state cycling driven by individual muscle actuators was used to produce two distinct pedal simulations. The simulations yielded the same pedaling rate and power output, but one reduced the MEE by avoiding eccentric muscle contractions. Contractile element force and length change in the individual muscles was used to quantify the total positive and negative work produced by the muscles. Three methods using external measurements were applied to the simulated movement. The three methods to quantify MEE were based on: (1) segment kinematic measurements, (2) work done by total joint powers and (3) intercompensated joint powers, i.e. negative work from one joint is transferred to an adjacent joint where energy is being generated (positive work) via biarticular muscles. The results showed that none of the MEE analyses were correlated to the MEE of the individual muscles, with errors reaching 40{\%}. Errors were mainly attributed to the inability of the MEE methods to account for co-contractions of antagonistic muscle groups. This phenomenon occurred primarily when one muscle generated force during activation while the antagonist generated force during deactivation.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to (1) determine whether bilateral asymmetry in cycling changed systematically with pedaling rate, (2) determine whether the dominant leg as identified by kicking contributed more to average power over a crank cycle than the other leg, and (3) determine whether the dominant leg asymmetry changed systematically with pedaling rate. To achieve these objectives, data were collected from 11 subjects who pedaled at five different pedaling rates ranging from 60 to 120rpm at a constant workrate of 260W. Bilateral pedal dynamometers measured two orthogonal force components in the plane of the bicycle. From these measurements, asymmetry was quantified by three dependent variables, the percent differences in average positive power ({\%}AP), average negative power ({\%}AN), and average crank power ({\%}AC). Differences were taken for two cases - with respect to the leg generating the greater total average for each power quantity at 60rpm disregarding the measure of dominance, and with respect to the dominant leg as determined by kicking. Simple linear regression analyses were performed on these quantities both for the subject sample and for individual subjects. For the subject sample, only the percent difference in average negative power exhibited a significant linear relationship with pedaling rate; as pedaling rate increased, the asymmetry decreased. Although the kicking dominant leg contributed significantly greater average crank power than the non-dominant leg for the subject sample, the non-dominant leg contributed significantly greater average positive power and average negative power than the dominant leg. However, no significant linear relationships for any of these three quantities with pedaling rate were evident for the subject sample because of high variability in asymmetry among the subjects. For example, significant linear relationships existed between pedaling rates and percent difference in total average power per leg for only four of the 11 subjects and the nature of these relationships was different (e.g. positive versus negative slopes). It was concluded that pedaling asymmetry is highly variable among subjects and that individual subjects may exhibit different systematic changes in asymmetry with pedaling rate depending on the quantity of interest.

abstract = {The goal of this research was to examine the accuracy of three methods used to indicate the hip joint center (HJC) in seated steady-state cycling. Two of the methods have been used in previous studies of cycling biomechanics and included tracking a marker placed over the superior aspect of the greater trochanter, a location that estimates the center of rotation of the hip joint, and assuming that the hip is fixed. The third method was new and utilized an anthropometric relationship to determine the hip joint location from a marker placed over the anterior-superior iliac spine. To perform a comparative analysis of errors inherent in the three methods, a standard method which located the true hip joint center was developed. The standard method involved establishing a pelvis-fixed coordinate system using a triad of video markers attached to an intracortical pin. Three-dimensional motion analysis quantified the true hip joint center position coordinates. To provide data for the comparative analysis, the intracortical pin was anchored to a single subject who pedaled at nine cadence-workrate combinations while data for all four methods were simultaneously recorded. At all cadence-workrate combinations the new method was more accurate than the trochanter method with movement errors lower by a factor of 2 in the vertical direction and a factor of 3 in the horizontal direction. Relative to the errors introduced by the fixed hip assumption, the new method was also generally more accurate by at least a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction and had comparable accuracy in the vertical direction. For computed kinetic quantities, the new method most accurately indicated hip joint force power but the fixed hip method most accurately indicated the work produced by the hip joint force over the crank cycle. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Previous work had identified six biomechanical functions that need to be executed by each limb in order to produce a variety of pedaling tasks. The functions can be organized into three antagonistic pairs: an Ext/Flex pair that accelerates the foot into extension or flexion with respect to the pelvis, an Ant/Post pair that accelerates the foot anteriorly or posteriorly with respect to the pelvis, and a Plant/Dorsi pair that accelerates the foot into plantarflexion or dorsiflexion. Previous analyses of experimental data have inferred that muscles perform the same function during different pedaling tasks (e.g. forward versus backward pedaling) because the EMG timing was similar, but they did not present rigorous biomechanical analyses to assess whether a muscle performed the same biomechanical function, and if so, to what degree. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine how individual muscles contribute to these biomechanical functions during two different motor tasks, forward and backward pedaling, through a theoretical analysis of experimental data. To achieve this objective, forward and backward pedaling simulations were generated and a mechanical energy analysis was used to examine how muscles generate, absorb or transfer energy to perform the pedaling tasks. The results showed that the muscles contributed to the same primary biomechanical functions in both pedaling directions and that synergistic performance of certain functions effectively accelerated the crank. The gluteus maximus worked synergistically with the soleus, the hip flexors worked synergistically with the tibialis anterior, and the vasti and hamstrings functioned independently to accelerate the crank. The rectus femoris used complex biomechanical mechanisms including negative muscle work to accelerate the crank. The negative muscle work was used to transfer energy generated elsewhere (primarily from other muscles) to the pedal reaction force in order to accelerate the crank. Consistent with experimental data, a phase shift was required from those muscles contributing to the Ant/Post functions as a result of the different limb kinematics between forward and backward pedaling, although they performed the same biomechanical function. The pedaling simulations proved necessary to interpret the experimental data and identify motor control mechanisms used to accomplish specific motor tasks, as the mechanisms were often complex and not always intuitively obvious.},

abstract = {The objective of this research was to use a pedal force decomposition approach to quantify the amount of negative muscular crank torque generated by a group of competitive cyclists across a range of pedaling rates. We hypothesized that negative muscular crank torque increases at high pedaling rates as a result of the activation dynamics associated with muscle force development and the need for movement control, and that there is a correlation between negative muscular crank torque and pedaling rate. To test this hypothesis, data were collected during 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 revolutions per minute (rpm) pedaling at a power output of 260W. The statistical analysis supported our hypothesis. A significant pedaling rate effect was detected in the average negative muscular crank torque with all pedaling rates significantly different from each other (p{\textless}0.05). There was no negative muscular crank torque generated at 60rpm and negligible amounts at 75 and 90rpm. But substantial negative muscular crank torque was generated at the two highest pedaling rates (105 and 120rpm) that increased with increasing pedaling rates. This result suggested that there is a correlation between negative muscle work and the pedaling rates preferred by cyclists (near 90rpm), and that the cyclists' ability to effectively accelerate the crank with the working muscles diminishes at high pedaling rates.

abstract = {The metabolic cost of producing submaximal cycling power has been reported to vary with pedaling rate. Pedaling rate, however, governs two physiological phenomena known to influence metabolic cost and efficiency: muscle shortening velocity and the frequency of muscle activation and relaxation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative influence of those two phenomena on metabolic cost during submaximal cycling. Nine trained male cyclists performed submaximal cycling at power outputs intended to elicit 30, 60, and 90{\%} of their individual lactate threshold at four pedaling rates (40, 60, 80, 100 rpm) with three different crank lengths (145, 170, and 195 mm). The combination of four pedaling rates and three crank lengths produced 12 pedal speeds ranging from 0.61 to 2.04 m/s. Metabolic cost was determined by indirect calorimetery, and power output and pedaling rate were recorded. A stepwise multiple linear regression procedure selected mechanical power output, pedal speed, and pedal speed squared as the main determinants of metabolic cost (R(2) = 0.99 +/- 0.01). Neither pedaling rate nor crank length significantly contributed to the regression model. The cost of unloaded cycling and delta efficiency were 150 metabolic watts and 24.7{\%}, respectively, when data from all crank lengths and pedal speeds were included in a regression. Those values increased with increasing pedal speed and ranged from a low of 73 +/- 7 metabolic watts and 22.1 +/- 0.3{\%} (145-mm cranks, 40 rpm) to a high of 297 +/- 23 metabolic watts and 26.6 +/- 0.7{\%} (195-mm cranks, 100 rpm). These results suggest that mechanical power output and pedal speed, a marker for muscle shortening velocity, are the main determinants of metabolic cost during submaximal cycling, whereas pedaling rate (i.e., activation-relaxation rate) does not significantly contribute to metabolic cost.},

abstract = {Matrix factorization algorithms are commonly used to analyze muscle activity and provide insight into neuromuscular control. These algorithms identify low-dimensional subspaces, commonly referred to as synergies, which can describe variation in muscle activity during a task. Synergies are often interpreted as reflecting underlying neural control; however, it is unclear how these analyses are influenced by biomechanical and task constraints, which can also lead to low-dimensional patterns of muscle activation. The aim of this study was to evaluate if commonly used algorithms and experimental methods can accurately identify synergy-based control strategies. This was accomplished by evaluating synergies from five common matrix factorization algorithms using muscle activations calculated from (1) a biomechanically constrained task using a musculoskeletal model and (2) without task constraints using random synergy activations. Although some of the algorithms could accurately estimate specified synergies without biomechanical or task constraints (similarity {\textgreater} 0.7), with these constraints the similarity of estimated synergies decreased significantly (0.3 - 0.4). The ability of these algorithms to accurately identify synergies was negatively impacted by covariance of synergy activations, which are increased when substantial biomechanical or task constraints are present. Increased variability in synergy activations, which can be captured using robust experimental paradigms that include natural variability in motor activation patterns, improved identification accuracy but did not completely overcome effects of biomechanical and task constraints. These results demonstrate that a biomechanically constrained task can reduce the accuracy of estimated synergies and highlight the importance of using experimental protocols with physiological variability to improve synergy analyses.},

Fifteen cyclists performed a Wingate anaerobic test, a graded exercise test (GXT) and a field-based 20-min TT with 2.7{\%} mean gradient. After a 5-week non-supervised training period, 10 of them performed a second TT for analysis of pacing reproducibility. Stepwise multiple regressions demonstrated that 91{\%} of TT mean power output variation (W kg−1) could be explained by peak oxygen uptake (ml kg−1.min−1) and the respiratory compensation point (W kg−1), with standardised beta coefficients of 0.64 and 0.39, respectively. The agreement between mean power output and power at respiratory compensation point showed a bias ± random error of 16.2 ± 51.8 W or 5.7 ± 19.7{\%}.

abstract = {Although the link between sagittal plane motion and exercise intensity has been highlighted, no study assessed if different workloads lead to changes in three-dimensional cycling kinematics. This study compared three-dimensional joint and segment kinematics between competitive and recreational road cyclists across different workloads. Twenty-four road male cyclists (12 competitive and 12 recreational) underwent an incremental workload test to determine aerobic peak power output. In a following session, cyclists performed four trials at sub-maximal workloads (65, 75, 85 and 95{\%} of their aerobic peak power output) at 90 rpm of pedalling cadence. Mean hip adduction, thigh rotation, shank rotation, pelvis inclination (latero-lateral and anterior-posterior), spine inclination and rotation were computed at the power section of the crank cycle (12 o'clock to 6 o'clock crank positions) using three-dimensional kinematics. Greater lateral spine inclination (p {\textless} .01, 5-16{\%}, effect sizes = 0.09-0.25) and larger spine rotation (p {\textless} .01, 16-29{\%}, effect sizes = 0.31-0.70) were observed for recreational cyclists than competitive cyclists across workload trials. No differences in segment and joint angles were observed from changes in workload with significant individual effects on spine inclination (p {\textless} .01). No workload effects were found in segment angles but differences, although small, existed when comparing competitive road to recreational cyclists. When conducting assessment of joint and segment motions, workload between 65 and 95{\%} of individual cyclists' peak power output could be used.},

@article{MacIntosh2000,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Based on the resistance-rpm relationship for cycling, which is not unlike the force-velocity relationship of muscle, it is hypothesized that the cadence which requires the minimal muscle activation will be progressively higher as power output increases. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, subjects were instrumented with surface electrodes placed over seven muscles that were considered to be important during cycling. Measurements were made while subjects cycled at 100, 200, 300, and 400 W at each cadence: 50, 60, 80, 100, and 120 rpm. These power outputs represented effort which was up to 32{\%} of peak power output for these subjects. RESULTS: When all seven muscles were averaged together, there was a proportional increase in EMG amplitude each cadence as power increased. A second-order polynomial equation fit the EMG:cadence results very well (r2 = 0.87- 0.996) for each power output. Optimal cadence (cadence with lowest amplitude of EMG for a given power output) increased with increases in power output: 57 +/- 3.1, 70 +/- 3.7, 86 +/- 7.6, and 99 +/- 4.0 rpm for 100, 200, 300, and 400 W, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results confirm that the level of muscle activation varies with cadence at a given power output. The minimum EMG amplitude occurs at a progressively higher cadence as power output increases. These results have implications for the sense of effort and preferential use of higher cadences as power output is increased.},

Tests were performed on two days. Maximal oxygen uptake was measured and the second ventilatory threshold was estimated on day 1 using a stationary bicycle. On day 2, the four different cadences were tested at about 5{\%} below the second ventilatory threshold. A strain gauge instrumented clip-less pedal mounted on the bicycle enabled us to measure the normal and tangential forces exerted on the pedal, while the pedal and crank angles were monitored with the aid of a video system. Based on this information, the effective force and the index of pedalling effectiveness were calculated. Cyclists produced significantly more effective force and a higher index of pedalling effectiveness at 60 and 75 rev/min and were significantly more economic at all cadences than triathletes. The significant and positive correlation between effective force and economy at all cadences suggests that improvement of the effective force would reflect on economy.},

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

Five minutes of submaximal cycling (180 W) were also undertaken, allowing the mean (DMA) and peak (PDA) activation from each muscle to serve as reference values. Finally, a 10 s cycling sprint (MxDA) trial was undertaken and the highest activation from each muscle was used as the reference value. Differences between reference EMG amplitude, as a function of normalization technique and time, were examined using repeated measures ANOVAs. The test-retest reliability of each technique was also examined using linear regression, intraclass correlations and Cronbach's alpha. The results showed that EMG amplitude differed significantly between normalization techniques for all muscles, with the IMVC and MxDA methods demonstrating the highest amplitudes. The highest levels of reliability were observed for the PDA technique for all muscles; therefore, our results support the utilization of this method for cycling analyses.},

Surface electromyography of the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and adductor magnus muscles of the bilateral legs was recorded during track cycling on velodromes with a 250-m track. The participants were instructed to maintain three different lap times: 20, 18 and 16 s. The average rectified value (ARV) was calculated from the sampled surface electromyography. Significantly higher ARVs were observed in the right compared to left leg for the biceps femoris muscle during both straight and curved sections at 18- and 16-s lap times (P {\textless} 0.05). In the biceps femoris muscle, significant changes in ARVs during the recovery phase with an increase in speed were seen in the right leg only (P {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant differences in ARVs between the straight and curved sections for all three muscles (P {\textgreater} 0.05). From our findings, it was suggested that during track cycling on a velodrome the laterality of the biceps femoris muscle activity is a key strategy to regulate the speed, and fixed neuromuscular strategies are adopted between straight and curved sections for thigh muscles.},

abstract = {Performance tests are an integral component of assessment for competitive cyclists in practical and research settings. Cycle ergometry is the basis of most of these tests. Most cycle ergometers are stationary devices that measure power while a cyclist pedals against sliding friction (e.g. Monark), electromagnetic braking (e.g. Lode), or air resistance (e.g. Kingcycle). Mobile ergometers (e.g. SRM cranks) allow measurement of power through the drive train of the cyclist's own bike in real or simulated competitions on the road, in a velodrome or in the laboratory. The manufacturers' calibration of all ergometers is questionable; dynamic recalibration with a special rig is therefore desirable for comparison of cyclists tested on different ergometers. For monitoring changes in performance of a cyclist, an ergometer should introduce negligible random error (variation) in its measurements; in this respect, SRM cranks appear to be the best ergometer, but more comparison studies of ergometers are needed. Random error in the cyclist's performance should also be minimised by choice of an appropriate type of test. Tests based on physiological measures (e.g. maximum oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold) and tests requiring self-selection of pace (e.g. constant-duration and constant-distance tests) usually produce random error of at least approximately 2 to 3{\%} in the measure of power output. Random error as low as approximately 1{\%} is possible for measures of power in 'all-out' sprints, incremental tests, constant-power tests to exhaustion and probably also time trials in an indoor velodrome. Measures with such low error might be suitable for tracking the small changes in competitive performance that matter to elite cyclists.},

abstract = {The cadence that maximises power output developed at the crank by an individual cyclist is conventionally determined using a laboratory test. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (i) to show that such a cadence, which we call the optimal cadence, can be determined using power output, heart-rate, and cadence measured in the field and (ii) to describe methodology to do so. For an individual cyclist's sessions, power output is related to cadence and the elicited heart-rate using a non-linear regression model. Optimal cadences are found for two riders (83 and 70 revolutions per minute, respectively); these cadences are similar to the riders' preferred cadences (82–92 rpm and 65–75 rpm). Power output reduces by approximately 6{\%} for cadences 20 rpm above or below optimum. Our methodology can be used by a rider to determine an optimal cadence without laboratory testing intervention: the rider will need to collect power output, heart-rate, and cadence measurements from training and racing sessions over an extended period ({\textgreater}6 months); ride at a range of cadences within those sessions; and calculate his/ her optimal cadence using the methodology described or a software tool that implements it.},

abstract = {Motor system may rely on a modular organization (muscle synergies activated in time) to execute different tasks. We investigated the common control features of walking and cycling in healthy humans, under the perspective of muscle synergies. Three hypotheses were tested: I) muscle synergies extracted from walking trials are similar to those extracted during cycling; II) muscle synergies extracted from one of these motor tasks can be used to mathematically reconstruct the electromyographic (EMG) patterns of the other task; III) muscle synergies of cycling can result from merging synergies of walking. A secondary objective was to identify at what speed (and cadence) higher similarities emerged. EMG activity from eight muscles of the dominant leg was recorded in eight healthy subjects during walking and cycling at four matched cadences. A factorization technique (non-negative matrix factorization, NNMF) was applied to extract individual muscle synergy vectors and the respective activation coefficients behind the global muscular activity of each condition. Results corroborated hypothesis II and III, showing that i) four synergies from walking and cycling can successfully explain most of the EMG variability of cycling and walking, respectively; and ii) two out of four synergies from walking appear to merge together to reconstruct one individual synergy of cycling, with best reconstruction values found for higher speeds. The direct comparison of the muscle synergy vectors of walking and muscle synergy vectors of cycling (hypothesis I) produced moderated values of similarity. This study provides supporting evidences to the hypothesis that cycling and walking share common neuromuscular mechanisms.},

We compared seven experienced rowers and eight untrained (i.e., inexperienced) subjects during rowing on an ergometer. Both surface electromyography activity and mechanical patterns (forces exerted at the handle and the foot-stretcher) were recorded during a high intensity rowing exercise. A non-negative matrix factorization was applied to 23 electromyographic patterns to differentiate muscle synergies. Results showed that expertise was not associated with different dimensionality in the electromyographic data and that three muscle synergies were sufficient to explain the majority of the variance accounted for (i.e., {\textgreater}90{\%} of the total variance) in the two populations. The synergies extracted were similar in the two populations, with identical functional roles. While the temporal organization of the propulsive synergies was very similar, slight differences were found in the composition of the muscle synergies (muscle synergy vectors) between the two populations. The results suggests that rowing expertise would not require the development of novel muscle synergies but would imply intrinsic synergies already used in different behaviors. Performance in rowing is more probably linked to adjustments in the mechanical output of the muscle synergies rather than to differences in the shape and timing of their activations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the pedalling technique in road cyclists of different competitive levels. Eleven professional, thirteen elite and fourteen club cyclists were assessed at the beginning of their competition season. Cyclists' anthropometric characteristics and bike measurements were recorded. Three sets of pedalling (200, 250 and 300 W) on a cycle ergometer that simulated their habitual cycling posture were performed at a constant cadence ({\~{}}90 rpm), while kinetic and kinematic variables were registered. The results showed no differences on the main anthropometric variables and bike measurements. Professional cyclists obtained higher positive impulse proportion (1.5-3.3{\%} and P {\textless} 0.05), mainly due to a lower resistive torque during the upstroke (15.4-28.7{\%} and P {\textless} 0.05). They also showed a higher ankle range of movement (ROM, 1.1-4.0° and P {\textless} 0.05). Significant correlations (P {\textless} 0.05) were found between the cyclists' body mass and the kinetic variables of pedalling: positive impulse proportion (r = -0.59 to -0.61), minimum (r = -0.59 to -0.63) and maximum torques (r = 0.35-0.47). In conclusion, professional cyclists had better pedalling technique than elite and club cyclists, because they opted for enhancing pulling force at the recovery phase to sustain the same power output. This technique depended on cycling experience and level of expertise.},

abstract = {Our aim was to determine whether muscle synergies are similar across trained cyclists (and thus whether the same locomotor strategies for pedaling are used), despite interindividual variability of individual EMG patterns. Nine trained cyclists were tested during a constant-load pedaling exercise performed at 80{\%} of maximal power. Surface EMG signals were measured in 10 lower limb muscles. A decomposition algorithm (nonnegative matrix factorization) was applied to a set of 40 consecutive pedaling cycles to differentiate muscle synergies. We selected the least number of synergies that provided 90{\%} of the variance accounted for VAF. Using this criterion, three synergies were identified for all of the subjects, accounting for 93.5+/-2.0{\%} of total VAF, with VAF for individual muscles ranging from 89.9+/-8.2{\%} to 96.6+/-1.3{\%}. Each of these synergies was quite similar across all subjects, with a high mean correlation coefficient for synergy activation coefficients (0.927+/-0.070, 0.930+/-0.052, and 0.877+/-0.110 for synergies 1-3, respectively) and muscle synergy vectors (0.873+/-0.120, 0.948+/-0.274, and 0.885+/-0.129 for synergies 1-3, respectively). Despite a large consistency across subjects in the weighting of several monoarticular muscles into muscle synergy vectors, we found larger interindividual variability for another monoarticular muscle (soleus) and for biarticular muscles (rectus femoris, gastrocnemius lateralis, biceps femoris, and semimembranosus). This study demonstrated that pedaling is accomplished by the combination of the similar three muscle synergies among trained cyclists. The interindividual variability of EMG patterns observed during pedaling does not represent differences in the locomotor strategy for pedaling.},

abstract = {During muscle contractions, the muscle fascicles may shorten at a rate different from the muscle-tendon unit, and the ratio of these velocities is its gearing. Appropriate gearing allows fascicles to reduce their shortening velocities and allows them to operate at effective shortening velocities across a range of movements. Gearing of the muscle fascicles within the muscle belly is the result of rotations of the fascicles and bulging of the belly. Variable gearing can also occur as a result of tendon length changes that can be caused by changes in the relative timing of muscle activity for different mechanical tasks. Recruitment patterns of slow and fast fibres are crucial for achieving optimal muscle performance, and coordination between muscles is related to whole limb performance. Poor coordination leads to inefficiencies and loss of power, and optimal coordination is required for high power outputs and high mechanical efficiencies from the limb. This paper summarizes key studies in these areas of neuromuscular mechanics and results from studies where we have tested these phenomena on a cycle ergometer are presented to highlight novel insights. The studies show how muscle structure and neural activation interact to generate smooth and effective motion of the body.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine which features of muscle mechanics and muscle coordination affect the power output from a limb during locomotion. Eight subjects were tested while cycling at maximum exertion for 25 min on a stationary dynamometer. Cadence and load were varied to span a range of power outputs and myoelectric activity was measured from 10 muscles in the leg. Cycle-by-cycle variations in muscle coordination, cadence and power output were observed and the EMG intensity across all muscles was used as an estimate of the metabolic cost for each cycle. Data for the cycles at greatest power output were separated into three groups: maximum power, 80{\%} power but lower EMG intensity and 80{\%} power and higher EMG intensity. Torque-angular velocity relations were determined for the ankle and knee joints. During cycling at maximum power output the ankle joint was not extending at the velocity necessary for maximum power output; thus, maximum limb power occurs when some of the individual muscles cannot be generating maximum power output. Increases in EMG intensity occurred with no increase in power output from the limb: these corresponded to decreases in the efficiency and changes in coordination. Increases in power were achieved that were not matched by equivalent increases in EMG intensity, but did occur with changes in coordination. It is proposed that the power output from the limb is limited by the coordination pattern of the muscles rather than the maximum power output from any one muscle itself.},

abstract = {Previous studies have reported how different populations of motor units (MUs) can be recruited during dynamic and locomotor tasks. It was hypothesised that the higher-threshold units would contribute higher-frequency components to the sEMG spectra due to their faster conduction velocities, and thus recruitment patterns that increase the proportion of high-threshold units active would lead to higher-frequency elements in the sEMG spectra. This idea was tested by using a model of varying recruitment coupled to a three-layer volume conductor model to generate a series of sEMG signals. The recruitment varied from (A) orderly recruitment where the lowest-threshold MUs were initially activated and higher-threshold MUs were sequentially recruited as the contraction progressed, (B) a recurrent inhibition model that started with orderly recruitment, but as the higher-threshold units were activated they inhibited the lower-threshold MUs (C) nine models with intermediate properties that were graded between these two extremes. The sEMG was processed using wavelet analysis and the spectral properties quantified by their mean frequency, and an angle ?? that was determined from the principal components of the spectra. Recruitment strategies that resulted in a greater proportion of faster MUs being active had a significantly lower ?? and higher mean frequency. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present review of cycling science focuses on the identification of criteria that affect the freely chosen cadence (FCC) during submaximal exercise of short and prolonged durations. Cadence selection during submaximal cycling constitutes a potential parameter affecting the endurance performance in subjects of varying aerobic fitness level and experience. The activity constraints such as specificity (e.g. cycle bout of triathlon) and exercise duration may play an important role in the selection of cadence and must be taken into consideration in the task description. The 'holistic' approach of this review is based on a multifactorial analysis considering the cycling constraints, and the physiological and biomechanical factors of cadence selection so as to establish any interrelationships between these factors. During cycle bouts of short duration ({\textless}15 min), it has been well argued that experienced cyclists, trained runners and triathletes adopt high cadences (80-100 rpm) systematically above the energetically optimal cadence (EOC) at which the oxygen uptake is minimal (55-65 rpm). The choice of a high cadence has been shown to be dependent upon several factors, such as the aerobic fitness level, the reduction in forces applied to the cranks, the lower extremity net joint moments and minimal neuromuscular fatigue. However, with increasing exercise duration the FCC has been reported to be close to the EOC exclusively in endurance athletes practising a variety of activities, suggesting an impact of training mode on the muscular adaptations and the organisation of the movement pattern. ?? 2009 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {Muscle-tendon gearing is the ratio of the muscle-tendon unit velocity to the fascicle velocity and can be expressed as the product of the gearing within the muscle belly and the gearing due to tendon stretch. Previous studies have shown that gearing is variable and increases at higher velocities. Changes in the muscle activation levels and force development have been suggested to affect tendon gearing and thus muscle-tendon unit gearing. However, the role of belly gearing as a part of muscle-tendon gearing and its associations with structural aspects of muscle and thus movement performance are important facets that need to be studied. The two gastrocnemii of twenty young adults were tested during isokinetic and isotonic contractions on an ankle dynamometer. Ultrasound images of both muscles were collected during contractions and were later digitised. Gearing was also predicted using a 2-dimensional panel model of these muscles. The results from experimental and models tests showed increases in gearing with greater torque levels at slower contraction velocities. However, in the isotonic models there was a substantial increase in gearing at faster contraction velocities. The level of muscle-tendon unit gearing is largely determined by the belly gearing, but its variability is driven by changes in tendon gearing that in turn is a factor of the muscle activation and coordination. The belly thickness of the medial gastrocnemius decreased during contractions, but increased for the lateral gastrocnemius. It is likely that changes to the belly shape and 3-dimensional structure are important to the gearing of the muscle.},

abstract = {This study investigates the motor unit recruitment patterns between and within muscles of the triceps surae during cycling on a stationary ergometer at a range of pedal speeds and resistances. Muscle activity was measured from the soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) using surface electromyography (EMG) and quantified using wavelet and principal component analysis. Muscle fascicle strain rates were quantified using ultrasonography, and the muscle-tendon unit lengths were calculated from the segmental kinematics. The EMG intensities showed that the body uses the SOL relatively more for the higher-force, lower-velocity contractions than the MG and LG. The EMG spectra showed a shift to higher frequencies at faster muscle fascicle strain rates for MG: these shifts were independent of the level of muscle activity, the locomotor load and the muscle fascicle strain. These results indicated that a selective recruitment of the faster motor units occurred within the MG muscle in response to the increasing muscle fascicle strain rates. This preferential recruitment of the faster fibres for the faster tasks indicates that in some circumstances motor unit recruitment during locomotion can match the contractile properties of the muscle fibres to the mechanical demands of the contraction.},

abstract = {Muscles are commonly assumed to have uniform activations across their bellies. Yet animal studies have shown that different regions across a muscle can vary in their architecture, fibre type, levels of activation and the transfer of forces to the bones and tendons. The purpose of this study was to test whether regional variations in activity occurred across the soleus, medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius in man, and whether these regional variations changed with altered mechanical demands on the limb. Arrays of surface electrodes were placed over these muscles and the electromyograms (EMG) measured for a range of cycling tasks where the resistance and pedal velocity was independently altered. Significant variations in the magnitude and timing of the EMG occurred across these muscles, which were most pronounced in the gastrocnemii and occurred in both the proximodistal and mediolateral directions. The patterns of variation across the muscles changed in response to the altered mechanical demands during the cycling. It is likely that the muscle fascicles in the gastrocnemii contribute varied mechanical functions to the contractions that depend on both their location within the muscle belly and on the mechanical requirements of the movement.},

abstract = {Muscle synergies have been proposed as building blocks that could simplify the construction of motor behaviors. However, the muscles within synergistic groups may have different architectures, mechanical linkages to the skeleton, and biochemical properties, and these put competing demands on the most appropriate way to activate them for different mechanical tasks. This study identifies the extent to which synergistic patterns of muscle activity vary when the mechanical demands on a limb were altered, and additionally identifies how consistent the spectral profiles of the electromyographic (EMG) intensities were across the different movement tasks. The muscle activities were measured with surface EMG across 10 muscles in the leg during cycling at a range of loads and velocities. The EMGs were quantified by their intensities in time-frequency space using wavelet analysis; the instantaneous patterns of activity identified using principal component analysis, statistically compared and further visualized using the varimax rotation. Variability (35.7{\%}) in the patterns of activity between the muscles were correlated with the torque and velocity of the pedal crank. Anatomic groups of muscles share a common mechanical action across a joint; uncoupling between such muscles was identified in 68.8{\%} of the varimax patterns that encompassed all 10 muscles and 20.8-29.5{\%} of the activity patterns when the anatomic groups were analyzed separately. The EMG spectra showed greatest heterogeneity for the gastrocnemii. These results show that the activity of muscles within anatomic groups is partially uncoupled in response to altered mechanical demands on the limb.},

abstract = {Cycling performance is affected by the interaction of a number of variables, including environment, mechanical, and human factors. Engineers have focused on the development of more efficient bicycles. Kinesiologists have examined cycling performance from a human perspective. This paper summarizes only certain aspects of human ergonomics of cycling, especially those which are important for the recent current research in our departments. Power is a key to performance of physical work. During locomotion an imaginary flow of energy takes place from the metabolism to the environment, with some efficiency. The 'useful' mechanical muscle power output might be used to perform movements and to do work against the environment. The external power is defined as the sum of joint powers, each calculated as the product of the joint (net) moment and angular velocity. This definition of external power is closely related to the mean external power as applied to exercise physiology: the sum of joint powers reflects all mechanical power which in principle can be used to fulfil a certain task. In this paper, the flow of energy for cycling is traced quantitatively as far as possible. Studies on the total lower limb can give insight into the contribution of individual muscles to external power. The muscle velocity (positive or negative) is obtained from the positions and orientations of body segments and a bar linkage model of the lower limb. The muscle activity can be measured by electromyography. In this way, positive and negative work regions in individual muscles are identified. Synergy between active agonistic/antagonistic muscle groups occurs in order to deliver external power. Maximum power is influenced by body position, geometry of the bicycle and pedalling rate. This has to be interpreted in terms of the length-tension and force-velocity-power relationships of the involved muscles. Flat road and uphill cycling at different saddle-tube angles is simulated on an ergometer. The measured pedal forces (magnitude and direction) are only dependent on the intersegmental orientation of saddle tube, crank position, upper and lower leg, and foot. The changed direction of the gravitational force with respect to the saddle-tube does not interfere with the co-ordinated force production pattern. During locomotory cycling at constant speed the external power is mainly used to overcome the aerodynamic friction force. This force and the rolling resistance are determined by coasting down experiments, yielding the external power.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {This study investigated the influence of cycle frequency and workload on muscle coordination and the ensuing relationship with mechanical efficiency and power output of human limb movement. Eleven trained cyclists completed an array of cycle frequency (cadence)-power output conditions while excitation from 10 leg muscles and power output were recorded. Mechanical efficiency was maximized at increasing cadences for increasing power outputs and corresponded to muscle coordination and muscle fiber type recruitment that minimized both the total muscle excitation across all muscles and the ineffective pedal forces. Also, maximum efficiency was characterized by muscle coordination at the top and bottom of the pedal cycle and progressive excitation through the uniarticulate knee, hip, and ankle muscles. Inefficiencies were characterized by excessive excitation of biarticulate muscles and larger duty cycles. Power output and efficiency were limited by the duration of muscle excitation beyond a critical cadence (120–140 rpm), with larger duty cycles and disproportionate increases in muscle excitation suggesting deteriorating muscle coordination and limitations of the activation-deactivation capabilities. Most muscles displayed systematic phase shifts of the muscle excitation relative to the pedal cycle that were dependent on cadence and, to a lesser extent, power output. Phase shifts were different for each muscle, thereby altering their mechanical contribution to the pedaling action. This study shows that muscle coordination is a key determinant of mechanical efficiency and power output of limb movement across a wide range of mechanical demands and that the excitation and coordination of the muscles is limited at very high cycle frequencies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess muscle coordination during a specific all-out sprint cycling task (Sprint). The aim was to estimate the EMG activity level of each muscle group by referring to the submaximal cycling condition (Sub150 W) and to test the hypothesis that a maximal activity is reached for all of the muscles during Sprint.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Fifteen well-trained cyclists were tested during submaximal and sprint cycling exercises and a series of maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) in isometric and isokinetic modes (MVC at the three lower limb joints). Crank torque and surface EMG signals for 11 lower limb muscles were continuously measured.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results showed that Sprint induced a very large increase of EMG activity level for the hip flexors (multiplied by 7-9 from 150 W to Sprint) and the knee flexors and hip extensors (multiplied by 5-7), whereas plantar flexors and knee extensors demonstrated a lower increase (multiplied by 2-3). During Sprint, EMG activity level failed to reach a maximal value for hamstrings, tibialis anterior, tensor fasciae latae, and gluteus maximus (i.e., {\textless}70{\%} to 80{\%} of peak EMG activity during MVC, P {\textless} 0.05 to P {\textless} 0.001), and individual EMG patterns demonstrated a significant earlier onset and/or later offset for the majority of the muscles (P {\textless} 0.01 to P {\textless} 0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Results clearly suggest a change in the relative contribution of the different muscles to the power production between Sub150 W and Sprint, and provide evidence that EMG activity level is not systematically maximal for all muscles involved in the all-out sprint cycling task. The longer period of activity induced during Sprint is likely to represent an interesting coordination strategy to enhance the work generated by all of the muscle groups.},

Eighteen physically active participants performed 8 x 10 s repeated sprints while muscle activity was recorded via surface electromyography (sEMG) from the brachioradialis (BR), biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB) and upper trapezius (UT). Measurements were obtained at rest, during a functional maximum contraction (FMC) while participants were positioned in a seated position on the cycle ergometer and during the repeated sprint protocol. Results suggest that mainly type I muscle fibres (MFs) are being recruited within the upper body musculature due to the submaximal and intermittent nature of the contractions. Subsequently, there is no evidence of upper body fatigue across the sprints, which is reflected in the lack of changes in the median frequency of the power spectrum (P{\textless}005).},

abstract = {Animals produce rapid movements using fast cyclical muscle contractions. These types of movements are better suited to faster muscle fibres within muscles of mixed fibre types as they can shorten at faster velocities and achieve higher activation-deactivation rates than their slower counterparts. Preferential recruitment of faster muscle fibres has previously been shown during high velocity contractions. Additionally, muscle deactivation takes longer than activation and therefore may pose a limitation to fast cyclical contractions. It has been speculated that slower fibres may be deactivated before faster fibres to accommodate their longer deactivation time. This study aimed to test whether shifts in muscle fibre recruitment occur with derecruitment of slow fibres before faster fibres at high cycle frequencies. Electromyographic (EMG) signals were collected from the medial gastrocnemius at an extreme range of cycle frequencies and workloads. Wavelets were used to resolve the EMG signals into time and frequency space and the primary sources of variability within the EMG frequency spectra were identified through principal component analysis. Early derecruitment of slower fibres was evident at the end of muscle excitation at higher cycle frequencies, as determined by reduced low-frequency EMG content, and additional slower fibre recruitment was present at the highest cycle frequency. The duration of muscle excitation reached a minimum of about 150 ms and did not change for the three highest cycle frequencies, suggesting a duration limit for the medial gastrocnemius. This study provides further evidence of modifications of muscle fibre recruitment strategies to meet the mechanical demands of movement.},

abstract = {Metabolic rates can increase 21 times above resting levels during cycling with the majority attributed to muscular contractions. Metabolic estimates attained through gas exchange parameters are limited by the respiration rate and time delay with respect to these contractions. In contrast surface electromyography (EMG) contains instantaneous muscle contraction information at higher temporal resolutions. An adequate metabolic power-EMG relationship has not been established to use EMG as a metabolic estimate during dynamic activities. The purpose of this study was to establish a metabolic power-EMG relationship during non steady-state conditions. Participants cycled at workloads between 25 and 90{\%} O2max while EMG and gas exchange were monitored. The EMG was resolved into intensities and total EMG intensity was calculated as the sum of intensities across all muscles for each pedal cycle. Metabolic power was estimated from gas exchange parameters and the mean total EMG intensity between breaths was calculated and used as breath-by-breath values. Comparisons were made between breath-by-breath resolutions of metabolic power and total EMG intensity. Different weighting coefficients were also applied to the EMG for each muscle to analyze the effects of different muscle weightings on metabolic power estimations. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.91) between estimates of metabolic power from EMG and gas exchange. Muscle weighting had a significant effect on metabolic power determination with the highest and lowest correlated estimates having the largest weightings on muscles proximal and distal to the knee respectively. This study demonstrates that EMG contains important information about the metabolic costs of muscle contractions and provides good predictions of metabolic changes during non steady-state conditions. Also, the importance of each muscle is workload dependent with inappropriate weightings reducing metabolic estimations. These findings have implications for future EMG applications as they provide more immediate, higher temporal resolution predictions of changes in metabolic power.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: Cycling is a repetitive activity using coordinated muscle recruitment patterns to apply force to the pedals. With more muscles available for activation than required, some patterns produce high power, whereas some are more efficient. The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between muscle coordination and factors affecting muscle coordination to explain changes in overall mechanical efficiency ($\eta$O).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Surface EMG, kinematics, and pedal forces were measured at 25{\%}, 40{\%}, 55{\%}, 60{\%}, 75{\%}, and 90{\%} V˙O(2max). Principal component analysis was used to establish muscle coordination, kinematic, and pedal force patterns associated with high and low $\eta$O.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At 55{\%}-60{\%} V˙O(2max), $\eta$O was maximized and was highly related to the muscle coordination patterns. At high $\eta$O, there was more medial and lateral gastrocnemii and soleus; less gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, and tibialis anterior; later medial and lateral vastii and biceps femoris; and earlier semitendinosus muscle activity resulting in an even distribution and synchronization of peak activity. Also, the ankle was more plantar flexed through the top and downstroke of the pedal cycle and more dorsiflexed during the upstroke for high $\eta$O. The $\eta$O was independent of the pedal force application.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that increased $\eta$O is achieved through the coordination of muscles crossing the same joint, sequential peak activation from knee to hip to ankle, and reliance on multiple muscles for large joint torques. Also, muscle activity variability across the top and bottom of the cycle indicates that left and right leg muscle coordination may play a significant role in efficient cycling. These findings imply that cycling at 55{\%}-60{\%} V˙O(2max) will maximize the rider's exposure to high efficient muscle coordination and kinematics.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The critical power (CP) model includes two constants: the CP and the W' [P = (W' / t) + CP]. The W' is the finite work capacity available above CP. Power output above CP results in depletion of the W' complete depletion of the W' results in exhaustion. Monitoring the W' may be valuable to athletes during training and competition. Our purpose was to develop a function describing the dynamic state of the W' during intermittent exercise.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: After determination of V˙O(2max), CP, and W', seven subjects completed four separate exercise tests on a cycle ergometer on different days. Each protocol comprised a set of intervals: 60 s at a severe power output, followed by 30-s recovery at a lower prescribed power output. The intervals were repeated until exhaustion. These data were entered into a continuous equation predicting balance of W' remaining, assuming exponential reconstitution of the W'. The time constant was varied by an iterative process until the remaining modeled W' = 0 at the point of exhaustion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The time constants of W' recharge were negatively correlated with the difference between sub-CP recovery power and CP. The relationship was best fit by an exponential (r = 0.77). The model-predicted W' balance correlated with the temporal course of the rise in V˙O(2) (r = 0.82-0.96). The model accurately predicted exhaustion of the W' in a competitive cyclist during a road race.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have developed a function to track the dynamic state of the W' during intermittent exercise. This may have important implications for the planning and real-time monitoring of athletic performance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE We recently presented an integrating model of the curvature constant of the hyperbolic power-time relationship (W') that permits the calculation of the W' balance (W'BAL) remaining at any time during intermittent exercise. Although a relationship between recovery power and the rate of W' recovery was demonstrated, the effect of the length of work or recovery intervals remains unclear. METHODS After determining VO2max, critical power, and W', 11 subjects completed six separate exercise tests on a cycle ergometer on different days, and in random order. Tests consisted of a period of intermittent severe-intensity exercise until the subject depleted approximately 50{\%} of their predicted W'BAL, followed by a constant work rate (CWR) exercise bout until exhaustion. Work rates were kept constant between trials; however, either work or recovery durations during intermittent exercise were varied. The actual W' measured during the CWR (W'ACT) was compared with the amount of W' predicted to be available by the W'BAL model. RESULTS Although some differences between W'BAL and W'ACT were noted, these amounted to only -1.6 ± 1.1 kJ when averaged across all conditions. The W'ACT was linearly correlated with the difference between VO2 at the start of CWR and VO2max (r = 0.79, P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The W'BAL model provided a generally robust prediction of CWR W'. There may exist a physiological optimum formulation of work and recovery intervals such that baseline VO2 can be minimized, leading to an enhancement of subsequent exercise tolerance. These results may have important implications for athletic training and racing.},

abstract = {Gordon KE, Ferris DP, Kuo AD. Metabolic and mechanical energy costs of reducing vertical center of mass movement during gait. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that reducing vertical center of mass (COM) displacement will lower the metabolic cost of human walking. To examine changes in joint work associated with increasing and decreasing vertical COM movement during gait. Design: Randomized repeated measures. Setting: Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of Michigan. Participants: Able-bodied subjects (N=10). Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.2m/s on a treadmill and overground. Subjects manipulated vertical COM displacement either by adjusting stride length or by using visual feedback to reduce COM movement. Main Outcome Measures: We measured kinematic and kinetic data to calculate vertical and lateral COM displacements, joint torques, and work. In addition, we collected oxygen consumption to calculated metabolic power. Results: Increasing and decreasing vertical COM displacement beyond subjects' preferred range resulted in increases in the metabolic cost of walking. When vertical COM displacement was reduced, corresponding increases in positive ankle and hip work and negative knee work were observed. Conclusions: Humans are capable of walking in a manner that will reduce COM displacement from normal. Decreasing vertical COM movement results in increases in metabolic energy costs because of greater mechanical work performed at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Thus, reducing vertical COM movement is not a successful strategy for improving either metabolic or mechanical energy economy during normal walking by able-bodied subjects. ?? 2009 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {Understanding the solid biomechanics of the human body is important to the study of structure and function of the body, which can have a range of applications in healthcare, sport, wellbeing, and workflow analysis. Conventional laboratorybased biomechanical analysis systems and observation-based tests are only designed to capture brief snapshots of the mechanics of movement. With recent developments in wearable sensing technologies, biomechanical analysis can be conducted in less constrained environments, thus allowing continuous monitoring and analysis beyond laboratory settings. In this paper, we review the current research in wearable sensing technologies for biomechanical analysis, focusing upon sensing and analytics that enable continuous, long-term monitoring of kinematics and kinetics in a free-living environment. The main technical challenges, including measurement drift, external interferences, nonlinear sensor properties, sensor placement, and muscle variations that can affect the accuracy and robustness of existing methods, and different methods for reducing the impact of these sources of errors are described in this review. Recent developments in motion estimation in kinematics, mobile force sensing in kinematics, sensor reduction for electromyography, as well as the future direction of sensing for biomechanics are also discussed.},

abstract = {In the medical field, there is a need for small ambulatory sensor systems for measuring the kinematics of body segments. Current methods for ambulatory measurement of body orientation have limited accuracy when the body moves. The aim of the paper was to develop and validate a method for accurate measurement of the orientation of human body segments using an inertial measurement unit (IMU). An IMU containing three single-axis accelerometers and three single-axis micromachined gyroscopes was assembled in a rectangular box, sized 20 x 20 x 30 mm. The presented orientation estimation algorithm continuously corrected orientation estimates obtained by mathematical integration of the 3D angular velocity measured using the gyroscopes. The correction was performed using an inclination estimate continuously obtained using the signal of the 3D accelerometer. This reduces the integration drift that originates from errors in the angular velocity signal. In addition, the gyroscope offset was continuously recalibrated. The method was realised using a Kalman filter that took into account the spectra of the signals involved as well as a fluctuating gyroscope offset. The method was tested for movements of the pelvis, trunk and forearm. Although the problem of integration drift around the global vertical continuously increased in the order of 0.50 degrees s(-1), the inclination estimate was accurate within 3 degrees RMS. It was shown that the gyroscope offset could be estimated continuously during a trial. Using an initial offset error of 1 rad s(-1), after 2 min the off-set error was roughly 5{\%} of the original offset error. Using the Kalman filter described, an accurate and robust system for ambulatory motion recording can be realised.},

abstract = {Abstract: In the sport of alpine skiing, knowledge about the centre of mass (CoM) kinematics (i.e. position, velocity and acceleration) is essential to better understand both performance and injury. This study proposes a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based method to measure CoM kinematics without restriction of capture volume and with reasonable set-up and processing requirements. It combines the GNSS antenna position, terrain data and the accelerations acting on the skier in order to approximate the CoM location, velocity and acceleration. The validity of the method was assessed against a reference system (video-based 3D kinematics) over 12 turn cycles on a giant slalom skiing course. The mean (± s) position, velocity and acceleration differences between the CoM obtained from the GNSS and the reference system were 9 ± 12 cm, 0.08 ± 0.19 m {\textperiodcentered} s-1 and 0.22 ± 1.28 m {\textperiodcentered} s-2, respectively. The velocity and acceleration differences obtained were smaller than typical differences between the measures of several skiers on the same course observed in the literature, while the position differences were slightly larger than its discriminative meaningful change. The proposed method can therefore be interpreted to be technically valid and adequate for a variety of biomechanical research questions in the field of alpine skiing with certain limitations regarding position. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {In this pilot study fusion motion capture (FMC) has been used to capture 3-D kinetics and kinematics of alpine ski racing. The new technology has overcome the technological difficulties associated with athlete performance monitoring in an alpine environment. FMC is a general term to describe motion capture when several different streams of data are fused to measure athlete motion. In this article inertial measurement units (IMU), global positioning system (GPS) pressure sensitive insoles, video and theodolite measurements have been combined. The core of the FMC is the fusion of IMU and GPS data. IMU may contain accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers and a thermometer, and they track local orientation and acceleration of each limb segment of interest. GPS data are fused with local acceleration data to track the global trajectory of the athlete. Fusion integration algorithms designed by the authors [1] were used to improve the accuracy of the independent Kalman filter solutions provided by the vendors of both the GPS and IMU. The GPS accuracy was improved from a dilution of precision of 75 m (meaning 50{\%} of the measurements will be within 5 m of the true value) to a maximum error of 71.5 m over the race course, while the IMU orientation error was reduced from over 201 to less than 51. The reader is invited to assess the validity of these results by comparing videos of the motion to the fusion motion capture output in the electronic version of this manuscript. Accuracy in laboratory situations has been validated, [2,3] but because such systems are becoming more popular, this system needs to be validated on the snow. As more accurate dual frequency GPS systems become less expensive this type of system will become more accurate and affordable. A biomechanical analysis was undertaken of a New Zealand Alpine Ski Racing Team member negotiating a 10-gate giant slalom course over 300 m in length. The abundant data in the results were used to create new tools for measuring alpine ski racing technique, such as colour-coded force vector analysis. The new parameters introduced in this article, such as effective inclination and ground reaction force power, are independent of the stylistic constraints often imposed by the coach or athlete. Two ski runs have been compared. Although the difference between the two run times was only 0.14 s or 1{\%}, FMC and force vector analysis were able to pick up the subtle changes in technique between the two runs. It is believed the analyses will provide useful design parameters to ski equipment engineers and will allow athlete feedback through augmented reality animations about variables, including limb dynamics, centre of mass (CoM) trajectory, CoM velocity, and external forces. In-depth analysis of the changes in net joint torques with changes in athlete posture may be useful for coaching athlete specific technique changes to improve performance and reduce injury potential. In addition, it is possible to extract key performance indicators about the athlete's physical and physiological limits, such as the mean coefficient of wind drag and the maximum inclination angle while turning, which may be used to optimise race strategies. There are tentative plans to use an improved version of a similar motion capture system to analyse forerunners on the FIS world cup race circuit. The purpose is to reduce knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and provide a visual biomechanical analysis of an athlete running the course to enhance the experience of the television audience. In alpine ski racing, forerunners ski the course before the first athlete to set ski tracks through the gates and check the safety of the course.},

abstract = {Energy expenditure during bicycling on flat terrain depends predominantly on air resistance, which is a function of total frontal area (bicycle and rider), coefficient of drag, and air speed. Body position on the bicycle may affect energy expenditure by altering either frontal area or coefficient of drag. In this study, oxygen uptake (VO2) was measured for each of four body positions in 10 cyclists (8 males, 2 females, 24 +/- 2 yr, 67.7 +/- 3.3 kg, VO2max = 65.8 +/- 1.5 ml.kg-1.min-1) while each bicycled up a 4{\%} incline on a motor-driven treadmill (19.3 km.h-1), thereby eliminating air resistance. Positions studied included: 1) seated, hands on brake hoods, cadence 80 rev.min-1; 2) seated, hands on dropped bar (drops), 80 rev.min-1; 3) standing, hands on brake hoods, 60 rev.min-1; and 4) seated, hands on brake hoods, 60 rev.min-1. Subjects rode their own bicycles, which were equipped with a common set of racing wheels. Energy expenditure, expressed as VO2 per unit combined weight, was not significantly different between drops and hoods positioning (30.2 +/- 0.6 vs 29.9 +/- 0.9 ml.kg-1.min-1) but was significantly greater for standing compared with seated cycling (31.7 +/- 0.4 vs 28.3 +/- 0.7 ml.kg-1.min.-1, P less than 0.01). These results indicate that body posture can affect energy expenditure during uphill bicycling through factors unrelated to air resistance.},

abstract = {Although the 3D trajectory of the body centre of mass during ambulation constitutes the 'locomotor signature' at different gaits and speeds for humans and other legged species, no quantitative method for its description has been proposed in the literature so far. By combining the mathematical discoveries of Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830, analysis of periodic events) and of Jules Antoine Lissajous (1822-1880, parametric equation for closed loops) we designed a method simultaneously capturing the spatial and dynamical features of that 3D trajectory. The motion analysis of walking and running humans, and the re-processing of previously published data on trotting and galloping horses, as moving on a treadmill, allowed to obtain closed loops for the body centre of mass showing general and individual locomotor characteristics. The mechanical dynamics due to the different energy exchange, the asymmetry along each 3D axis, and the sagittal and lateral energy recovery, among other parameters, were evaluated for each gait according to the present methodology. The proposed mathematical description of the 3D trajectory of the body centre of mass could be used to better understand the physiology and biomechanics of normal locomotion, from monopods to octopods, and to evaluate individual deviations with respect to average values as resulting from gait pathologies and the restoration of a normal pattern after pharmacological, physiotherapeutic and surgical treatments. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: An understanding of normal pelvic motion during seated cycling is relevant to saddle design and bicycle fitting. In this study, we investigated the effects of gender, power, and hand position on pelvic motion throughout a pedal stroke. We also investigated whether anthropometric factors could explain any interindividual differences observed. METHODS: Twelve experienced male and 14 experienced female cyclists participated. Each subject was custom fitted to a stationary bicycle and then rode the bicycle at three power outputs (100, 150, and 200 W), with their hands in the tops and drops position. The kinematics of a triad of motion-capture markers, located on posterior pelvic landmarks, were used to characterize pelvic motion. RESULTS: The largest angular excursions were observed in the nonsagittal planes, with the pelvis rotating internally (approximately 3 degrees ) and rolling laterally ( approximately 2 degrees ) toward the downstroke. These pelvic rotations caused the hip on the downstroke side to translate anteriorly and inferiorly. Compared with males, females exhibited greater average anterior pelvic tilt in the drops hand position (males: 21 +/- 3 degrees ; females: 24 +/- 4 degrees ; P = 0.036). Interindividual differences in pelvic motion could not be independently explained by measures of ischial tuberosity width or hamstring flexibility. However, average anterior pelvic tilt was negatively correlated with lumbar flexibility among the males (r = 0.75; P = 0.024), suggesting that this may be an important factor to consider in bicycle fitting. CONCLUSIONS: We observed substantial pelvic motion during seated cycling, with experienced female road cyclists exhibiting greater average anterior tilt than their male counterparts. Pelvic motion seems to arise naturally during seated cycling and should be considered when designing saddles and establishing bicycle-fitting procedures.},

abstract = {Recent observations of a bicyclist riding through town and on a treadmill show that the rider uses the upper body very little when performing normal maneuvers and that the bicyclist may, in fact, primarily use steering input for control. The observations also revealed that other motions such as lateral movement of the knees were used in low speed stabilization. In order to validate the hypothesis that there is little upper body motion during casual cycling, an in-depth motion capture analysis was performed on the bicycle and rider system. We used motion capture technology to record the motion of three similar young adult male riders riding two different city bicycles on a treadmill. Each rider rode each bicycle while performing stability trials at speeds ranging from 2 km/h to 30 km/h: stabilizing while pedaling normally, stabilizing without pedaling, line tracking while pedaling, and stabilizing with no-hands. These tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization. Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling. These motions were grouped on the basis of correlation and conclusions were drawn about which motions are candidates for stabilization-related control actions.},

abstract = {People with amputation move asymmetrically with regard to kinematics (joint angles) and kinetics (joint forces and moments). Clinicians have traditionally sought to minimize kinematic asymmetries, assuming kinetic asymmetries would also be minimized. A cycling model evaluated locomotor asymmetries. Eight individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation pedaled with 172 mm-length crank arms on both sides (control condition) and with the crank arm length shortened to 162 mm on the amputated side (CRANK condition). Pedaling kinetics and limb kinematics were recorded. Joint kinetics, joint angles (mean and range of motion ROM]), and pedaling asymmetries were calculated from force pedals and with a motion capture system. A one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc compared kinetics and kinematics across limbs. Statistical significance was set to p {\textless}/= 0.05. The CRANK condition reduced hip and knee ROM in the amputated limb compared with the control condition. There were no differences in joint kinematics between the contralateral and amputated limbs during the CRANK condition. Pedaling asymmetries did not differ and were 23.0{\%} +/– 9.8{\%} and 23.2{\%} +/– 12.0{\%} for the control and CRANK conditions, respectively. Our results suggest that minimizing kinematic asymmetries does not relate to kinetic asymmetries as clinically assumed. We propose that future research should concentrate on defining acceptable asymmetry.},

abstract = {Postural control strategies have in the past been predominantly characterized by kinematics, surface forces and EMG responses (e.g. Horak and Nashner 1986 Journal of Neurophysiology 55(6), 1369-1381). The goal of this study was to provide unique and novel insights into the underlying motor mechanisms used in postural control by determining the joint moments during balance recovery from medio-lateral (M/L) perturbations. Ten adult males received medio-lateral (M/L) pushes to the trunk or pelvis. The inverted pendulum model of balance control (Winter et al. 1998 Journal of Neurophysiology 80, 1211-1221) was validated even though the body did not behave as a single pendulum, indicating that the centre of pressure (COP) is the variable used to control the centre of mass (COM). The perturbation magnitude was random, and the central nervous system (CNS) responded with an estimate of the largest anticipated perturbation. The observed joint moments served to move the COP in the appropriate direction and to control the lateral collapse of the trunk. The individual joints involved in controlling the COP contributed differing amounts to the total recovery response: the hip and spinal moments provided the majority of the recovery ({\~{}}85{\%}), while the ankles contributed a small, but significant amount (15{\%}). The differing contributions are based on the anatomical constraints and the functional requirements of the balance task. The onset of the joint moment was synchronous with the joint angle change, and occurred too early (56-116ms) to be result of active muscle contraction. Therefore, the first line of defense was provided by muscle stiffness, not reflex-activated muscle activity. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The task under study is the stabilization of the mostly unstable lateral motion of the bicycle-rider system. This is done by visual observation of the rider and measuring the vehicle motions. The observations show that very little upper-body lean occurs and that stabilization is done by steering control actions only. However, at very low forward speed a second control is introduced to the system: knee movement. Moreover, all control actions are performed at the pedaling frequency, whilst the amplitude of the steering motion increases rapidly with decreasing forward speed.},

A unique capability of the dynamometer is the ability to interface with multiple pedal platforms of varying height while maintaining a desired elevation of the fool above the pedal spindle axis. The dynamometer was designed using a concept described in an earlier article by Quinn and Mote which measures shear strain across multiple, thin cross-sections. An optimal design technique was used for choosing dimensions of the load measuring cross-sections. A dynamometer was designed and built using the optimal results. Calibration, accuracy results, and sample data are presented. A comparison of accuracy reveals that the new dynamometer is more accurate than previously reported instruments.},

The theoretical analysis of this force platform was realized by the Finite Element method, with the simulation of 384 combinations of static loads (force and moments) at different directions. Deformation data numerically obtained is related to the position were sensors will be placed. Output signals obtained were numerically organized and graphically analyzed, in order to show the mathematical relation between force and strain, which is used to generate a "calibration matrix", free of mechanical coupling which usually appears in multiaxis systems. At last, a test was made, simulating an input load, and the output signal obtained was practically equal.},

abstract = {This review presents information that is useful to athletes, coaches and exercise scientists in the adoption of exercise protocols, prescription of training regimens and creation of research designs. Part 2 focuses on the factors that affect cycling performance. Among those factors, aerodynamic resistance is the major resistance force the racing cyclist must overcome. This challenge can be dealt with through equipment technological modifications and body position configuration adjustments. To successfully achieve efficient transfer of power from the body to the drive train of the bicycle the major concern is bicycle configuration and cycling body position. Peak power output appears to be highly correlated with cycling success. Likewise, gear ratio and pedalling cadence directly influence cycling economy/efficiency. Knowledge of muscle recruitment throughout the crank cycle has important implications for training and body position adjustments while climbing. A review of pacing models suggests that while there appears to be some evidence in favour of one technique over another, there remains the need for further field research to validate the findings. Nevertheless, performance modelling has important implications for the establishment of performance standards and consequent recommendations for training.},

abstract = {This study investigated the changes in muscle coordination associated to power output decrease during a 30-s isokinetic (120rpm) cycling sprint. Modifications in EMG amplitude and onset/offset were investigated from eight muscles [gluteus maximus (EMGGMAX), vastus lateralis and medialis obliquus (EMGVAS), medial and lateral gastrocnemius (EMGGAS), rectus femoris (EMGRF), biceps femoris and semitendinosus (EMGHAM)]. Changes in co-activation of four muscle pairs (CAIGMAX/GAS, CAIVAS/GAS, CAIVAS/HAM and CAIGMAX/RF) were also calculated. Substantial power reduction (60??6{\%}) was accompanied by a decrease in EMG amplitude for all muscles other than HAM, with the greatest deficit identified for EMGRF (31??16{\%}) and EMGGAS (20??14{\%}). GASonset, HAMonset and GMAXonset shifted later in the pedalling cycle and the EMG offsets of all muscles (except GASoffset) shifted earlier as the sprint progressed (P{\textless}0.05). At the end of the sprint, CAIVAS/GAS and CAIGMAX/GAS were reduced by 48??10{\%} and 43??12{\%}, respectively. Our results show that substantial power reduction during fatiguing sprint cycling is accompanied by marked reductions in the EMG activity of bi-articular GAS and RF and co-activation level between GAS and main power producer muscles (GMAX and VAS). The observed changes in RF and GAS EMG activity are likely to result in a redistribution of the joint powers and alterations in the orientation of the pedal forces. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Pedal force effectiveness in cycling is usually measured by the ratio of force perpendicular to the crank (effective force) and total force applied to the pedal (resultant force). Most studies measuring pedal forces have been restricted to one leg but a few studies have reported bilateral asymmetry in pedal forces. Pedal force effectiveness is increased at higher power output and reduced at higher pedaling cadences. Changes in saddle position resulted in unclear effects in pedal force effectiveness, while lowering the upper body reduced pedal force effectiveness. Cycling experience and fatigue had unclear effects on pedal force effectiveness. Augmented feedback of pedal forces can improve pedal force effectiveness within a training session and after multiple sessions for cyclists and non-cyclists. No differences in pedal force effectiveness were evident between summarized and instantaneous feedback. Conversely, economy/efficiency seems to be reduced when cyclists are instructed to improve pedal force effectiveness during acute intervention studies involving one session. Decoupled crank systems effectively improved pedal force effectiveness with conflicting effects on economy/efficiency and performance.},

Therefore, we assessed the effects of saddle height on pedal forces, joint mechanical work and kinematics in 12 cyclists and 12 triathletes. Four sub-maximal 2-min cycling trials (3.4 W/kg and 90 rpm) were conducted using preferred, low and high saddle heights (±10° knee flexion at 6 o'clock crank position from the individual preferred height) and an advocated optimal saddle height (25° knee flexion at 6 o'clock crank position). Right pedal forces and lower limb kinematics were compared using effect sizes (ES). Increases in saddle height (5{\%} of preferred height, ES=4.6) resulted in large increases in index of effectiveness (7{\%}, ES=1.2) at the optimal compared to the preferred saddle height for cyclists. Greater knee (11-15{\%}, ES=1.6) and smaller hip (6-8{\%}, ES=1.7) angles were observed at the low (cyclists and triathletes) and preferred (triathletes only) saddle heights compared to high and optimal saddle heights. Smaller hip angle (5{\%}, ES=1.0) and greater hip range of motion (9{\%}, ES=1.0) were observed at the preferred saddle height for triathletes compared to cyclists. Changes in saddle height up to 5{\%} of preferred saddle height for cyclists and 7{\%} for triathletes affected hip and knee angles but not joint mechanical work.

abstract = {Many researchers have used cycling exercise to evaluate muscle metabolism. Inherent in such studies is an assumption that changes in whole-body respiration are due solely to respiration at the working muscle. Some researchers, however, have speculated that the metabolic cost of torso stabilization may contribute to the metabolic cost of cycling. Therefore, our primary purpose was to determine whether a torso stabilization device would reduce the metabolic cost of producing cycling power. Our secondary purpose was to determine the validity of the ergometer used in this study. Nine male cyclists cycled on a Velotron cycle ergometer at mechanical power outputs intended to elicit 50, 75, and 100{\%} of their ventilatory threshold at 40, 60, and 80 rpm, with and without torso stabilization. Power was controlled by the Velotron in iso-power mode and measured with an SRM powermeter. We determined metabolic cost by indirect calorimetery and recorded power output. Torso stabilization significantly reduced metabolic cost of producing submaximal power (1{\%}), and reduction tended to be greatest at the lower pedaling rates where pedaling force was greatest (1.6{\%} at 40 rpm, 1.2{\%} at 60 rpm, 0.2{\%} at 80 rpm). Power, measured with the SRM powermeter, was strongly correlated with that specified to the Velotron ergometer control unit (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.99). We conclude that muscular contractions associated with torso stabilization elicit significant metabolic costs, which tend to be greatest at low pedaling rates. Researchers who intend to make precise inferences regarding metabolism in the working muscles of the legs may wish to provide torso stabilization as a means of reducing variability, particularly when comparing metabolic data across a wide range of pedaling rates.},

abstract = {Previous authors have reported power-pedaling rate relationships for maximal cycling. However, the joint-specific power-pedaling rate relationships that contribute to pedal power have not been reported. We determined absolute and relative contributions of joint-specific powers to pedal power across a range of pedaling rates during maximal cycling. Ten cyclists performed maximal 3 s cycling trials at 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 rpm. Joint-specific powers were averaged over complete pedal cycles, and extension and flexion actions. Effects of pedaling rate on relative joint-specific power, velocity, and excursion were assessed with regression analyses and repeated-measures ANOVA. Relative ankle plantar flexion power (25 to 8{\%}; P = .01; R(2) = .90) decreased with increasing pedaling rate, whereas relative hip extension power (41 to 59{\%}; P {\textless} .01; R(2) = .92) and knee flexion power (34 to 49{\%}; P {\textless} .01; R(2) = .94) increased with increasing pedaling rate. Knee extension powers did not differ across pedaling rates. Ankle joint angular excursion decreased with increasing pedaling rate (48 to 20 deg) whereas hip joint excursion increased (42 to 48 deg). These results demonstrate that the often-reported quadratic power-pedaling rate relationship arises from combined effects of dissimilar joint-specific power-pedaling rate relationships. These dissimilar relationships are likely influenced by musculoskeletal constraints (ie, muscle architecture, morphology) and/or motor control strategies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the preferred cycling cadence of professional riders during competition. METHODS We measured the cadence of seven professional cyclists (28 +/- 1 yr) during 3-wk road races (Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and Vuelta a Espa{\~{n}}a) involving three main competition requirements: uphill cycling (high mountain passes of approximately 15 km, or HM); individual time trials of approximately 50 km on level ground (TT); and flat, long ( approximately 190 km) group stages (F). Heart rate (HR) data were also recorded as an indicator of exercise intensity during HM, TT, and F. RESULTS Mean cadence was significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.01) during HM (71.0 +/- 1.4 rpm) than either F and TT (89.3 +/- 1.0 and 92.4 +/- 1.3 rpm, respectively). HR was similar during HM and TT (157 +/- 4 and 158 +/- 3 bpm) and in both cases higher (P {\textless} 0.01) than during F (124 +/- 2 bpm). CONCLUSION During both F and TT, professional riders spontaneously adopt higher cadences (around 90 rpm) than those previously reported in the majority of laboratory studies as being the most economical. In contrast, during HM they seem to adopt a more economical pedalling rate (approximately 70 rpm), possibly as a result of the specific demands of this competition phase.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Seat pressure during cycling and its relationship to urological disorders have been discussed extensively in recently published literature. The effects of exercise configuration on seat pressure, however, still have not been fully investigated. AIM This study evaluates the effects of two different pedaling workloads and two saddle designs on saddle pressure in 22 (11 men and 11 women) recreational cyclists (bicycling {\textless}2 hours per week). METHODS Seat pressure was measured in the saddle surface while pedaling at workloads of 150 and 300 W using a plain and a holed saddle model, both without any gel cushion characteristics. Analysis of variance was applied to compare seat pressure between situations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Study the importance of bicycle saddle pressure. RESULTS Mean seat pressure was not different between men and women. For the plain saddle, the men's average seat pressure increased as the workload increased. Using a holed saddle, the mean pressure increased as the workload increased, regardless of gender. CONCLUSIONS The increase of workload increased the seat pressure for the subjects, with the main effects dependent on workload. The use of a holed saddle was not directly related to lesser seat pressure during cycling. Our results support our understanding of a similarity between genders related to mean seat pressure, and suggest that different workload ranges may present different results for seat pressure.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a causal relationship between pedalling "circularity" and cycling efficiency. Eleven trained cyclists were studied during submaximal cycling. Variables recorded included gross and delta efficiency and the ratio of minimum to peak torque during a duty cycle. Participants also completed a questionnaire about their training history. The most notable results were as follows: gross efficiency (r = -0.72, P {\textless} 0.05 at 250 W) was inversely correlated with the ratio of minimum to peak torque, particularly at higher work rates. There was a highly significant inverse correlation between delta efficiency and average minimum torque at 200 W (r = -0.76, P {\textless} 0.01). Cycling experience was positively correlated with delta efficiency and gross efficiency, although experience and the ratio of minimum to peak torque were not related. These results show that variations in pedalling technique may account for a large proportion of the variation in efficiency in trained cyclists. However, it is also possible that some underlying physiological factor influences both. Finally, it appears that experience positively influences efficiency, although the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To use measurement by cycling power meters (Pmes) to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used models for estimating uphill cycling power (Pest). Experiments were designed to explore the influence of wind speed and steepness of climb on accuracy of Pest. The authors hypothesized that the random error in Pest would be largely influenced by the windy conditions, the bias would be diminished in steeper climbs, and windy conditions would induce larger bias in Pest. METHODS: Sixteen well-trained cyclists performed 15 uphill-cycling trials (range: length 1.3-6.3 km, slope 4.4-10.7{\%}) in a random order. Trials included different riding position in a group (lead or follow) and different wind speeds. Pmes was quantified using a power meter, and Pest was calculated with a methodology used by journalists reporting on the Tour de France. RESULTS: Overall, the difference between Pmes and Pest was -0.95{\%} (95{\%}CI: -10.4{\%}, +8.5{\%}) for all trials and 0.24{\%} (-6.1{\%}, +6.6{\%}) in conditions without wind ({\textless}2 m/s). The relationship between percent slope and the error between Pest and Pmes were considered trivial. CONCLUSIONS: Aerodynamic drag (affected by wind velocity and orientation, frontal area, drafting, and speed) is the most confounding factor. The mean estimated values are close to the power-output values measured by power meters, but the random error is between ±6{\%} and ±10{\%}. Moreover, at the power outputs ({\textgreater}400 W) produced by professional riders, this error is likely to be higher. This observation calls into question the validity of releasing individual values without reporting the range of random errors.},

abstract = {When cycling on level ground at a speed greater than 14 m/s, aerodynamic drag is the most important resistive force. About 90{\%} of the total mechanical power output is necessary to overcome it. Aerodynamic drag is mainly affected by the effective frontal area which is the product of the projected frontal area and the coefficient of drag. The effective frontal area represents the position of the cyclist on the bicycle and the aerodynamics of the cyclist-bicycle system in this position. In order to optimise performance, estimation of these parameters is necessary. The aim of this study is to describe and comment on the methods used during the last 30 years for the evaluation of the effective frontal area and the projected frontal area in cycling, in both laboratory and actual conditions. Most of the field methods are not expensive and can be realised with few materials, providing valid results in comparison with the reference method in aerodynamics, the wind tunnel. Finally, knowledge of these parameters can be useful in practice or to create theoretical models of cycling performance.},

abstract = {This study was designed to examine the biomechanical and physiological responses between cycling on the Axiom stationary ergometer (Axiom, Elite, Fontaniva, Italy) vs. field conditions for both uphill and level ground cycling. Nine cyclists performed cycling bouts in the laboratory on an Axiom stationary ergometer and on their personal road bikes in actual road cycling conditions in the field with three pedaling cadences during uphill and level cycling. Gross efficiency and cycling economy were lower (-10{\%}) for the Axiom stationary ergometer compared with the field. The preferred pedaling cadence was higher for the Axiom stationary ergometer conditions compared with the field conditions only for uphill cycling. Our data suggests that simulated cycling using the Axiom stationary ergometer differs from actual cycling in the field. These results should be taken into account notably for improving the precision of the model of cycling performance, and when it is necessary to compare two cycling test conditions (field/laboratory, using different ergometers).},

abstract = {Measurements of human strength can be important during analyses of physical activities. Such measurements have often taken the form of the maximum voluntary torque at a single joint angle and angular velocity. However, the available strength varies substantially with joint position and velocity. When examining dynamic activities, strength measurements should account for these variations. A model is presented of maximum voluntary joint torque as a function of joint angle and angular velocity. The model is based on well-known physiological relationships between muscle force and length and between muscle force and velocity and was tested by fitting it to maximum voluntary joint torque data from six different exertions in the lower limb. Isometric, concentric and eccentric maximum voluntary contractions were collected during hip extension, hip flexion, knee extension, knee flexion, ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. Model parameters are reported for each of these exertion directions by gender and age group. This model provides an efficient method by which strength variations with joint angle and angular velocity may be incorporated into comparisons between joint torques calculated by inverse dynamics and the maximum available joint torques. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract - Zatsiorsky et al. obtained, by means of a gamma-ray scanning technique, the relative body segment masses, center of mass (CM) positions, and radii of gyration for samples of college-aged Caucasian males and females. Although these data are the only available and comprehensive set of inertial parameters regarding young adult Caucasians, they have been rarely utilized for biomechanical analyses of subjects belonging to the same or a similar population. The main reason is probably that Zatsiorsky et al. used bony landmarks as reference points for locating segment CMs and defining segment lengths. Some of these landmarks were markedly distant from the joint centers currently used by most researchers as reference points. The purpose of this study was to adjust the mean relative CM positions and radii of gyration reported by Zatsiorsky et al., in order to reference them to the joint centers or other commonly used landmarks, rather than the original landmarks. The adjustments were based on a number of carefully selected sources of anthropometric data.},

abstract = {The determination of an accurate centre of rotation (CoR) from segment marker positions is of interest across a wide range of applications, but particularly for clinical gait analysis and for estimating the hip joint centre during surgical intervention of the knee, for limb alignment purposes. For the first time in this survey of formal methods, we classify, analyse and compare different methods (geometric, algebraic, bias compensated algebraic, and Pratt sphere fit methods, as well as the centre transformation technique, the Holzreiter approach, the helical pivot technique, the Schwartz transformation techniques, the minimal amplitude point method and the Stoddart approach) for the determination of spherical joint centres from marker position data. In addition, we propose a new method, the symmetrical CoR estimation or SCoRE, in which the coordinates of the joint centre must only remain constant relative to each segment, thus not requiring the assumption that one segment should remain at rest. For each method, 1000 CoR estimations were analysed with the application of isotropic, independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise (standard deviation 0.1 cm) to each of the marker positions, to all markers on the segment simultaneously and the two in combination. For the test conditions used here, most techniques were capable of determining the CoR to within 0.3 cm, as long as the spherical range of motion (RoM) of the joint was 45?? or more. Under the most stringent conditions tested, however, the SCoRE was capable of best determining the CoR, to within approximately 1.2 mm with a RoM of 20??. The correct selection and application of these methodologies should help improve the accuracy of surgical navigation and clinical kinematic measurement. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cadence is one of the only variables cyclists can adjust to manage their performance and fatigue during an event. Not surprisingly, cadence has received a great deal of attention from the scientific community in an effort to identify the cadence that optimizes power output while minimizing the fatigue that is incurred. The literature appears to present conflicting results with little consensus as regards the optimal pedalling cadence. This is in large part due to the inconsistent definition of the term “optimal” cadence, which has been used to describe energetic cost, muscular stress, and perception of effort. The issue is further confounded by the workload-dependent nature of the “optimal” cadence - that is, at higher power outputs, the optimized cadence is different from that at lower power outputs. Although the optimal cadence is different for energetic, muscular, and perceptual definitions, the curves that describe the effect of changes in cadence on these variables consistently exhibit a J-shaped response. This suggests that there is an underlying principle that is common to each of the definitions. Indeed, it would appear that the response of both the cardio-respiratory system (energetic cost) and the muscular system (muscular stress) is determined by the types of muscle motor units that are recruited during the exercise. Furthermore, although part of the response may be due to the inherent differences in the characteristics between the different motor units, the absolute contraction velocity relative to fibre type optimum may be of greater significance. Even when the power output is increased, the shape of the response curves to changes in cadence remains constant, although the nadir of the curve does shift to the right for increasing power outputs. We propose that the point at which the energetic vs. power and the muscular stress vs. power curves intercept is defined by the cadence at which the perceived effort is minimized (i.e. the preferred cadence). However, cadence fluctuations occur under field conditions that are unrelated to physiological factors and, therefore, the ability to identify an “optimal” cadence is limited to the laboratory environment and specific field conditions.},

abstract = {Motivated by the desire to provide information useful in the design analysis of bicycle frames, the hypothesis tested was that a simple linear model would relate the maximum magnitudes of rider-induced loads to rider weight. Rider-induced loads are loads developed as a result of weight and muscular actions during pedalling. To test this hypothesis, five riders spanning a wide weight range rode a bicycle unrestrained on a treadmill. Dynamometers measured six components of pedal loads and five components of both seat and handlebar loads while riders rode three common cycling situations - seated cruising, seated climbing, and standing climbing. Average, average maximum, and average minimum values were computed for all load components and each was analyzed statistically. For all three test cases, the regression slope was significant for the force component normal to the pedal surface. Because the normal pedal force component has been shown previously to dominate frame stress at the point most likely to fatigue (Hull and Bolourchi, 1988, J. Strain. Anal. 23, 105-114), the results of this study should be useful in designing frames optimized for minimum weight and acceptable structural reliability. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Background: The last several years have seen an increased interest in elucidating the causes of non-traumatic injuries specific to bicyclists. Injuries may include soreness of the pelvis, skin problems in the groin, erectile dysfunction, and impotence. Combined loading at the seat may be contributing factors to these injuries. Methods: Vertical and shear loads were collected for 10 subjects cycling at 75 crank revolutions per minute (RPM) in a common fit position. External workload was held constant at 125 watts while force data were collected using a multi-axis load cell integrated under the seat of a standard bicycle. The crank arm angles at which the maximum forces occurred were obtained using a motion analysis system, and regions of rider contact with the seat were visualized with a pressure mapping system. Findings: Measured vertical loads at the seat were greater than shear loads. Maximum mean vertical loads of 49-52{\%} body weight, rearward shear loads of 11-12{\%} body weight, and lateral shear loads of 4-5{\%} body weight occurred at the seat. Associated timing angles referenced to the pedal position were also measured and averaged at the maximum and minimum loads. Interpretation: Seat pressure mapping and blood flow have previously been used to study the interaction between bicyclists and their seats. This investigation focused on shear and vertical seat loads that may be contributing factors in injuries at the groin. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bicycle seat pressure is often examined by researchers exploring solutions for reducing seat injuries as it is thought a critical determinant; however, a reliable and valid methodology for this undertaking has not been reported. The current study was designed to address this shortcoming and to establish baseline interface pressure measurements for females and males. Participants completed two separate identical bicycle ergometer trials at 118 W in the tops and drops and at 300??82.4 W in top handlebar positions. Seat pressures were quantified from a pressure-sensing mat and the validity of the pressure system was examined through the relationship between known seat weights and the sum of seat pressures. Within trial intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranged between 0.90 and 0.99 and the between trial ICC values ranged between 0.02 and 0.96. The relationship (Pearson correlation coefficient) between seat weight and the sum of pressures was 0.97. Significant peak pressures were 39{\%} greater in the 118 W top than 300 W top handlebar condition and 29{\%} greater than the 118 W drop handlebar condition (p{\textless}0.05). The gender comparison revealed that significant male peak pressure values were greater (24{\%}) and that female values were less influenced by the hand position factor. Select within trial pressure measurements were found to be reliable during pedaling and valid statically. Additionally, the results indicated that workrate and hand position were factors influencing seat pressure and that males and females responded differently to adjustments of these factors. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent studies have reported evidence that the motor system may rely on a modular organization, even if this behavior has yet to be confirmed during motor adaptation. The aim of the present study is to investigate the modular motor control mechanisms underlying the execution of pedaling by untrained subjects in different biomechanical conditions. We use the muscle synergies framework to characterize the muscle coordination of 11 subjects pedaling under two different conditions. The first one consists of a pedaling exercise with a strategy freely chosen by the subjects (Preferred Pedaling Technique, PPT), while the second condition constrains the gesture by means of a real time visual feedback of mechanical effectiveness (Effective Pedaling Technique, EPT). Pedal forces, recorded using a pair of instrumented pedals, were used to calculate the Index of Effectiveness (IE). EMG signals were recorded from eight muscles of the dominant leg and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was applied for the extraction of muscle synergies. All the synergy vectors, extracted cycle by cycle for each subject, were pooled across subjects and conditions and underwent a 2-dimensional Sammon's non-linear mapping. Seven representative clusters were identified on the Sammon's projection, and the corresponding eight-dimensional synergy vectors were used to reconstruct the repertoire of muscle activation for all subjects and all pedaling conditions (VAF {\textgreater} 0.8 for each individual muscle pattern). Only 5 out of the 7 identified modules were used by the subjects during the PPT pedaling condition, while 2 additional modules were found specific for the pedaling condition EPT. The temporal recruitment of three identified modules was highly correlated with IE. The structure of the identified modules was found similar to that extracted in other studies of human walking, partly confirming the existence of shared and task specific muscle synergies, and providing further evidence on the modularity of the motor system.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to determine whether muscle synergies are constrained by changes in the mechanics of pedaling. The decomposition algorithm used to identify muscle synergies was based on two components: "muscle synergy vectors," which represent the relative weighting of each muscle within each synergy, and "synergy activation coefficients," which represent the relative contribution of muscle synergy to the overall muscle activity pattern. We hypothesized that muscle synergy vectors would remain fixed but that synergy activation coefficients could vary, resulting in observed variations in individual electromyographic (EMG) patterns. Eleven cyclists were tested during a submaximal pedaling exercise and five all-out sprints. The effects of torque, maximal torque-velocity combination, and posture were studied. First, muscle synergies were extracted from each pedaling exercise independently using non-negative matrix factorization. Then, to cross-validate the results, muscle synergies were extracted from the entire data pooled across all conditions, and muscle synergy vectors extracted from the submaximal exercise were used to reconstruct EMG patterns of the five all-out sprints. Whatever the mechanical constraints, three muscle synergies accounted for the majority of variability [mean variance accounted for (VAF) = 93.3 ± 1.6{\%}, VAF (muscle) {\textgreater} 82.5{\%}] in the EMG signals of 11 lower limb muscles. In addition, there was a robust consistency in the muscle synergy vectors. This high similarity in the composition of the three extracted synergies was accompanied by slight adaptations in their activation coefficients in response to extreme changes in torque and posture. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that these muscle synergies reflect a neural control strategy, with only a few timing adjustments in their activation regarding the mechanical constraints.},

Handlebar loadings and upper limb kinematics were collected from 17 participants performing seated or standing pedaling trials in a random order at 6 crank powers ranging from 20{\%} (112±19W) to 120{\%} (675±113W) of their spontaneous sit-to-stand transition power. An inverse dynamics approach was used to compute 3D 2 moments, powers, and works at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints. Over 29 parameters investigated, increases in crank power were associated with increases in the magnitudes of 23 and 20 of the kinetic variables assessed in seated and standing positions, respectively. The standing position was associated with higher magnitudes of upper limb kinetics. These results suggest that both upper and lower limbs should be considered in future models in order to better understand whole body coordination in cycling},

One open issue is the preferred cadence of trained cyclists while hill climbing. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the affect of cycling position on economy and preferred cadence in trained cyclists while they climbed a moderate grade hill at various power outputs. Eight trained cyclists (25.8 +/- 7.2 years, [Formula: see text] 68.8 +/- 5.0 ml kg(-1) min(-1), peak power 407.6 +/- 69.0 W) completed a seated and standing hill climb at approximately 50, 65 and 75{\%} of peak power output (PPO) in the order shown, although cycling position was randomized, i.e., half the cyclists stood or remained seat on their first trial at each power output. Cyclists also performed a maximal trial unrestricted by position. Heart rate, power output, and cadence were measured continuously with a power tap; ventilation [Formula: see text], BF and cadence were significantly higher with seated climbing at all intensities; there were no other physiological differences between the climbing positions. These data support the premise that trained cyclists are equally economical using high or low cadences, but may face a limit to benefits gained with increasing cadence.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine lower lumbar kinematics in cyclists with and without non-specific chronic low back pain (NS-CLBP) during a cross-sectional cycling field study. Although LBP is a common problem among cyclists, studies investigating the causes of LBP during cycling are scarce and are mainly focussed on geometric bike-related variables. Until now no cycling field studies have investigated the relationship between maladaptive lumbar kinematics and LBP during cycling. Eight cyclists with NS-CLBP classified as having a 'Flexion Pattern' (FP) disorder and nine age- and gender-matched asymptomatic cyclists were tested. Subjects performed a 2 h outdoor cycling task on their personal race bike. Lower lumbar kinematics was measured with the BodyGuard??? monitoring system. Pain intensity during and after cycling was measured using a numerical pain rating scale. The NS-CLBP (FP) subjects were significantly more flexed at the lower lumbar spine during cycling compared to healthy controls (p = 0.018), and reported a significant increase in pain over the 2 h of cycling (p {\textless} 0.001). One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for group (p = 0.035, F = 5.546) which remained just significant when adding saddle angle as a covariate (p = 0.05, F = 4.747). The difference in posture between groups did not change over time. These findings suggest that a subgroup of cyclists with NS-CLBP (FP) demonstrate an underlying maladaptive motor control pattern resulting in greater lower lumbar flexion during cycling which is related to a significant increase in pain. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Alterations in kinetic patterns of pedal force and crank torque due to changes in surface grade (level vs. 8{\%} uphill) and posture (seated vs. standing) were investigated during cycling on a computerized ergometer. Kinematic data from a planar cine analysis and force data from a pedal instrumented with piezoelectric crystals were recorded from multiple trials of 8 elite cyclists. These measures were used to calculate pedal force, pedal orientation, and crank torque profiles as a function of crank angle in three conditions: seated level, seated uphill, and standing uphill. The change in surface grade from level to 8{\%} uphill resulted in a shift in pedal angle (toe up) and a moderately higher peak crank torque, due at least in part to a reduction in the cycling cadence. However, the overall patterns of pedal and crank kinetics were similar in the two seated conditions. In contrast, the alteration in posture from sitting to standing on the hill permitted the subjects to produce different patterns of pedal and crank kinetics, characterized by significantly higher peak pedal force and crank torque that occurred much later in the downstroke. These kinetic changes were associated with modified pedal orientation (toe down) throughout the crank cycle. Further, the kinetic changes were linked to altered nonmuscular (gravitational and inertial) contributions to the applied pedal force, caused by the removal of the saddle as a base of support.},

The assumption, however, that maximal laboratory power is similar to field power has received limited attention. The purpose of the study was to compare the maximal torque- and power-pedaling rate relationships during "all-out" sprints performed on laboratory ergometers and on moving bicycles with elite cyclists. Over a 3-day period, seven male (mean +/- SD; 180.0 +/- 3.0 cm; 86.2 +/- 6.1 kg) elite track cyclists completed two maximal 6 s cycle ergometer trials and two 65 m sprints on a moving bicycle; calibrated SRM powermeters were used and data were analyzed per revolution to establish torque- and power-pedaling rate relationships, maximum power, maximum torque and maximum pedaling rate. The inertial load of our laboratory test was (37.16 +/- 0.37 kg m(2)), approximately half as large as the field trials (69.7 +/- 3.8 kg m(2)). There were no statistically significant differences between laboratory and field maximum power (1791 +/- 169; 1792 +/- 156 W; P = 0.863), optimal pedaling rate (128 +/- 7; 129 +/- 9 rpm; P = 0.863), torque-pedaling rate linear regression slope (-1.040 +/- 0.09; -1.035 +/- 0.10; P = 0.891) and maximum torque (266 +/- 20; 266 +/- 13 Nm; P = 0.840), respectively. Similar torque- and power-pedaling rate relationships were demonstrated in laboratory and field settings. The findings suggest that maximal laboratory data may provide an accurate means of modeling cycling performance.},

abstract = {While the Wingate test is traditionally administered with the restriction that the subject stay seated, competition cyclists generally rise out of the saddle when sprinting. The purpose of this investigation, therefore, was to determine whether the results of Wingate tests are different if they are obtained when the subject is in a seated compared to a standing position. A group of 12 male cyclists, competing at the college level, performed four 30 s Wingate tests over the course of 2 weeks. Two practice tests were first administered, one with the subjects standing on the pedals and one with them seated, followed by two similar tests for the record in a randomized order. Each test was performed on a friction-loaded ergometer (resistance: 8.5{\%} body mass, starting cadence 60 rpm). For the standing tests, the participants rose out of the saddle when the load was applied and remained standing throughout. Power was computed using a commercially available software/ hardware package that accounted for both the load on the flywheel, and the flywheel and crank system acceleration. Power values in the standing and seated trials for the [mean (SD)] 1 s peak [19.4 (1.4) W x kg(-1), 17.9 (1.7) W x kg(-1)], 5 s peak [16.8 (0.9) W x kg(-1), 15.7 (1.1) W x kg(-1)], 30 s average [11.0 (0.4) W x kg(-1), 10.4 (0.6) W x kg(-1)], and 5 s minimal power [8.3 (0.5) W x kg(-1), 7.5 (0.6) W x kg(-1)] were all significantly greater in the standing compared to the seated trials (P {\textless} 0.01). However, the fatigue index was not significantly different [51 (5){\%} standing. 52 (5){\%} seated; P = 0.25]. Since greater power output was achieved when the subjects were standing on the pedals, it may be more appropriate to test cyclists when they are in the standing position to gain a better representation of their capability to exert maximal power.},

abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the maximal power output (POpeak) and force-velocity relationships in sprint cycling obtained from a laboratory protocol and from a field test during actual cycling locomotion. METHODS: Seven male competitive cyclists performed 6 sprints (3 in the seated position and 3 in the standing position) on an ergo-trainer (Tacx, Netherlands) and 6 sprints during actual cycling locomotion in a gymnasium. The bicycle was equipped with the SRM Training System (Schoberer Rad Messtechnik, Germany) to measure (200 Hz) the power output (PO, W), the pedalling cadence (rpm), and the velocity (kmxh-1). From these measurements, the maximal force on the pedal (Fmax), the theoretical maximal force (Fo, N) and the theoretical maximal pedalling cadence (V0, rpm) were determined. During each sprint test the lateral bicycle oscillations were measured from a video analysis. RESULTS: During standing and seated sprints in the gymnasium, Fo and Fmax were significantly higher (p{\textless}0.05) compared with sprints on the ergo-trainer (+12{\%} and +32{\%}, respectively). The POpeak during sprints in seated and standing positions in the gymnasium was significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower (-4{\%}) and higher (+6{\%}) respectively, compared with the ergo-trainer. For standing position in the gymnasium the kinematics analysis indicated a 24 degrees mean lateral bicycle oscillation compared with 0 degrees on the ergo trainer. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that POpeak, Fo, and time to obtain POpeak were different between laboratory and actual cycling conditions. To obtain a valid estimation of the maximal power output, it is necessary to perform sprint tests during actual cycling locomotion. Thus, in the laboratory, it is advisable to use a cycle ergometer that enables natural lateral oscillations.},

abstract = {This paper provides measurements of rider-induced loads during standing cycling. Two strain gauge dynamometers were used to measure these loads while three subjects rode bicycles on a large motorized treadmill; the cycling situation simulated hill climbing while standing. Comparing the results to those previously published for seated cycling revealed that the loading for standing cycling differed fundamentally from that for seated cycling in certain key respects. One respect was that the maximum magnitude normal pedal force reached substantially higher values, exceeding the weight of the subject and the phase occurred later in the crank cycle. Another respect was that the direction of the handlebar forces alternated indicating that the arms pulled up and back during the power stroke of the corresponding leg and pushed down and forward during the upstroke. Inasmuch as these forces were coordinated (i.e., in phase) with the leaning of the bicycle, the arms developed positive power.},

abstract = {The mechanical efficiency of cycling with a new pedal-crank prototype (PP) was investigated during an incremental test on a stationary cycloergometer. The efficiency values were compared with those obtained, in the same experimental conditions and with the same subjects, by using a standard pedal-crank system (SP). The main feature of this prototype is that its pedal-crank length changes as a function of the crank angle being maximal during the pushing phase and minimal during the recovery one. This variability was expected to lead to a decrease in the energy requirement of cycling since, for any given thrust, the torque exerted by the pushing leg is increased while the counter-torque exerted by the contra-lateral one is decreased. Whereas no significant differences were found between the two pedal-cranks at low exercise intensities (???=50-200W), at 250-300W the oxygen uptake (V??O2, W) was found to be significantly lower and the efficiency (??=???/V??O2) about 2{\%} larger (p{\textless}0.05, Wilcoxon test) in the case of PP. Even if the measured difference in efficiency was rather small, it can be calculated that an athlete riding a bicycle equipped with the patented pedal-crank could improve his 1h record by about 1km. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The methods for determining the bicycle frame stiffness exist in many forms. Because the measuring method is not standardized, each bicycle magazine or bicycle constructer uses his own test setup. This leads to a wide variety of setups; they differ in many aspects such as applied load, boundary conditions and frame deflection measurement. To clarify some misunderstandings in frame testing, a multi-directional rating test method for bicycle frame stiffness has been developed. Prior to testing the stiffness of different frames it is important to assess the confidence limits of the stiffness result. This includes (i) the contribution of the test bench due to its non-zero compliance, (ii) the influence of mounting the frame in the test bench with a certain preload, (iii) the errors related to the force-and displacement measurement and finally (iv) estimating the influence of experimenter This sensitivity analysis on the test bench already led to a better understanding of frame stiffness testing, and which minor modifications can lead to major differences in stiffness values. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the effects of cycling position (seated or standing) during level-ground and uphill cycling on gross external efficiency (GE) and economy (EC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eight well-trained cyclists performed in a randomized order five trials of 6-min duration at 75{\%} of peak power output either on a velodrome or during the ascent of a hill in seated or standing position. GE and EC were calculated by using the mechanical power output that was measured by crankset (SRM) and energy consumption by a portable gas analyzer (Cosmed K4b(2)). In addition, each subject performed three 30-s maximal sprints on a laboratory-based cycle ergometer or in the field either in seated or standing position.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: GE and EC were, respectively, 22.4 +/- 1.5{\%} (CV = 5.6{\%}) and 4.69 +/- 0.33 kJ x L(-1) (CV = 5.7{\%}) and were not different between level seated, uphill seated, or uphill standing conditions. Heart rate was significantly ( {\textless} 0.05) higher in standing position. In the uphill cycling trials, minute ventilation was higher ( {\textless} 0.05) in standing than in seated position. The average 30-s power output was higher ( {\textless} 0.01) in standing (803 +/- 103 W) than in seated position (635 +/- 123 W) or on the stationary ergometer (603 +/- 81 W).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Gradient or body position appears to have a negligible effect on external efficiency in field-based high-intensity cycling exercise. Greater short-term power can be produced in standing position, presumably due to a greater force developed per revolution. However, the technical features of the standing position may be one of the most determining factors affecting the metabolic responses.},

abstract = {Previous studies have sought to improve cycling performance by altering various aspects of the pedaling motion using novel crank-pedal mechanisms and non-circular chainrings. However, most designs have been based on empirical data and very few have provided significant improvements in cycling performance. The purpose of this study was to use a theoretical framework that included a detailed musculoskeletal model driven by individual muscle actuators, forward dynamic simulations and design optimization to determine if cycling performance (i.e., maximal power output) could be improved by optimizing the chainring shape to maximize average crank power during isokinetic pedaling conditions. The optimization identified a consistent non-circular chainring shape at pedaling rates of 60, 90 and 120 rpm with an average eccentricity of 1.29 that increased crank power by an average of 2.9{\%} compared to a conventional circular chainring. The increase in average crank power was the result of the optimal chainrings slowing down the crank velocity during the downstroke (power phase) to allow muscles to generate power longer and produce more external work. The data also showed that chainrings with higher eccentricity increased negative muscle work following the power phase due to muscle activation-deactivation dynamics. Thus, the chainring shape that maximized average crank power balanced these competing demands by providing enough eccentricity to increase the external work generated by muscles during the power phase while minimizing negative work during the subsequent recovery phase. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between road gradient (RG) and freely chosen cadence (FCC) in a group of professional cyclists during their normal training. In addition, a calculation of crank inertial load (CIL) was estimated in order to establish the relationship between FCC and CIL. Ten professional cyclists were monitored during training using commercially available power meters (Shoberer Rad Messtechnik (SRM), professional version). For each cyclist, recorded training sessions were reviewed to identify the hardest 6-8 training sessions (???18 h of training). RG was estimated based on the relationship between power output, total mass and speed. The analysis was performed using 2113??317 samples of 30 s average data, collected on terrain ranging from -4{\%}RG to 12{\%}RG. The individual relationship between FCC and RG could be described by a linear regression model. There was a moderate correlation between FCC and CIL (group's r=0.42), and a multiple regression including the measured power output (WPO) increased the variance explained (R2=0.24). The correlation was very large between CIL and v (r=0.91), and was not strengthened by adding WPO as an independent variable (r=0.91). In conclusion, this investigation documents that in professional cyclists engaged in training, there is a linear decrease in FCC as RG increases (-4{\%}RG and 12{\%}RG). This decrease in FCC appears to be due to the reduction in v as slope increases. It is surmised that CIL plays a key role in the modulation of FCC. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The value of electromyography (EMG) is sensitive to many physiological and non-physiological factors. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the torque-velocity test (T-V) can be used to normalize EMG signals into a framework of biological significance. Peak EMG amplitude of gluteus maximus (GMAX), vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris long head (BF), gastrocnemius medialis (GAS) and soleus (SOL) was calculated for nine subjects during isometric maximal voluntary contractions (IMVC) and torque-velocity bicycling tests (T-V). Then, the reference EMG signals obtained from IMVC and T-V bicycling tests were used to normalize the amplitude of the EMG signals collected for 15 different submaximal pedaling conditions. The results of this study showed that the repeatability of the measurements between IMVC (from 10{\%} to 23{\%}) and T-V (from 8{\%} to 20{\%}) was comparable. The amplitude of the peak EMG of VL was 99 ?? 43{\%} higher (p {\textless} 0.001) when measured during T-V. Moreover, the inter-individual variability of the EMG patterns calculated for submaximal cycling exercises differed significantly when using T-V bicycling normalization method (GMAX: 0.33 ?? 0.16 vs. 1.09 ?? 0.04, VL: 0.07 ?? 0.02 vs. 0.64 ?? 0.14, SOL: 0.07 ?? 0.03 vs. 1.00 ?? 0.07, RF: 1.21 ?? 0.20 vs. 0.92 ?? 0.13, BF: 1.47 ?? 0.47 vs. 0.84 ?? 0.11). It was concluded that T-V bicycling test offers the advantage to be less time and energy-consuming and to be as repeatable as IMVC tests to measure peak EMG amplitude. Furthermore, this normalization method avoids the impact of non-physiological factors on the amplitude of the EMG signals so that it allows quantifying better the activation level of lower limb muscles and the variability of the EMG patterns during submaximal bicycling exercises. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Modern bicycle disk-brake systems often induce vibration and noise in bike components such as brake rotors, wheels, and even bike frames. When the vibration or noise are excessive, brake performance can be perceived as unsatisfactory. Previous research incorporating bike frame structural dynamics and brake friction modeling has shown that stick-slip friction is likely the cause of much of this vibration and noise. Bicycle design parameters such as brake friction behavior and bike component structural properties are central in producing and/or sustaining these vibrations. The predicted dynamics of these models has correlated reasonably well with the testing of braking systems. This research extends the modelling of previous efforts to improve correspondence with brake noise/vibration testing and gain further understanding into the contributors and possible cures of this unwanted vibration. Specifically, the extended model incorporates torsional wheel dynamics (including rotor/hub, rim, and tire inertias, and spoke, rotor, and tire stiffnesses) into previous models. This new model allows the dynamics of the bike frame and wheel to couple through braking application. To support and validate the modelling, motion/vibration measurements are recorded during noisy braking with a non-contact laser vibrometer in the laboratory and with an accelerometer in field tests. Vibration measurements are studied along with model predictions toward the goal of connecting unwanted noise/vibration with specific design parameters of the bicycle brake-frame-wheel system.},

Vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs) and the center of pressure (COP) were examined in the range from 3 steps before to 3 steps after transition in order to identify the possible occurrence of a transition process, in order to facilitate the actual realization of transition. The actual transition is realized in one step, during WRT and RWT. This transition step was characterized by an outlying vertical GRF and COP trajectory (deviating from walking and running). Despite this clear discontinuity, a transitional adaptation period (process) appeared in both transitions. In the WRT, transition was prepared and kinetic adaptations were found in the last step before transition. The RWT was pre- and "post"-pared and only completed during the first walking step after transition. Thus, the WRT and RWT are two distinct phenomena, with different kinetics.},

The following hypotheses were therefore tested: (1) the standing position results in better performance at a high power output, while (2) the seated position is best at a moderate power output. We also assessed the seated-standing transition intensity, above which seated cycling should be superseded by standing cycling for maximization of performance. Ten male cyclists (mean age 27 years, s = 3; height 1.82 m, s = 0.07; body mass 75.2 kg, s = 7.0; VO2max 70.0 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), s = 5.2) performed seated and standing treadmill cycling to exhaustion at 10{\%} grade and at four power outputs ranging from 86{\%} to 165{\%} of their power output at maximal oxygen uptake (Wmax). Power output at maximal oxygen uptake was obtained during determination of VO2max. There was no difference in time to exhaustion between the two cycling positions at 86{\%} of Wmax (P = 0.29). All participants performed best at the highest power output (165{\%} of Wmax) when standing (P = 0.002). An overall seated-standing transition intensity of 94{\%} of Wmax was identified. Thus, in general, cyclists may choose either the standing or seated position for maximization of performance at a submaximal intensity of 86{\%} of Wmax, while the standing position should be used at intensities above 94{\%} of Wmax and approaching 165{\%} of Wmax.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to partly explain, from electromyographical (EMG) activity, the decrease in power output beyond optimal pedaling rate (PRopt) during sprint cycling. METHODS: Eleven cyclists performed four 8-s nonisokinetic sprints on a cycle ergometer against four randomized friction loads (0.5, twice 0.75, and 0.9 N x kg(-1) of body mass). Power output and EMG activity of both right and left gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and vastus lateralis were measured continuously. Individual crank cycles were analyzed. Crank angles corresponding to the beginning and the peak of each downstroke and EMG burst onset and offset crank angles were computed. Moreover, crank angles corresponding to the beginning and the end of muscle force response were determined assuming a 100-ms lag time between the EMG activity and the relevant force response (or electromechanical delay). RESULTS: Muscle coordination (EMG onset and offset) was altered at high pedaling rates. Thus, crank angles corresponding to muscle force response increased significantly with pedaling rate. Consequently, at pedaling rates higher than the optimal pedaling rate, force production of lower-limb extensor muscles was shifted later in the crank cycle. Mechanical data confirmed that downstrokes occurred later in the crank cycle when pedaling rate increased. Hence, force was produced on the pedals during less effective crank cycle sectors of the downstroke and during the beginning of the upstroke. CONCLUSION: During nonisokinetic sprint cycling, the decrease in power output when pedaling rates increased beyond PRopt may be partly explained by suboptimal muscle coordination.},

abstract = {Studies have indicated that the muscles work in a systematic and coordinated way to generate and direct power from the human body to the crank during cycling. Understanding of the muscle involvement or recruitment pattern during cycling will be useful for developing specific and effective muscle training and rehabilitation programs for cyclists. Moreover, it will also facilitate the use of the cycling ergometer for therapeutic purpose. This paper reviews the current literature on muscle recruitment pattern during cycling and the effects of muscle fatigue, cadence, riding posture and seat height on this recruitment pattern. In the power phase or 'downstroke', the hip, knee and ankle joints extend simultaneously for the pushing action, whilst in the recovery phase or 'upstroke', they flex together to pull the pedal back to the top dead center of the crank cycle. Recent studies have indicated that in this repeated sequence, the mono-articular muscles are mainly involved in the generation of positive work whereas the biarticular muscles are responsible for regulating force transmission. Some muscles co-activate during cycling to provide synergistic actions and other functional needs. Muscle fatigue is an important factor affecting cycling performance. It has been reported that muscle fatigue in the lower body would alter the cycling motion and muscle activation pattern. Therefore, studying the change of muscle activation pattern during cycling at the fatigued level may shed light on the sequel of local muscle fatigue. A muscle training program specifically for cycling can then be designed accordingly. Additionally, the change of cadence during cycling will affect the muscle recruitment pattern. There is a unique cadence that minimizes the muscle activation level at a specific level of power output. This cadence will increase as the power output increases. The change of riding posture from sitting to standing renders the pelvis unsupported and the body weight will assist the power phase of pedalling. Similarly, changes to the seat height will alter the posture which will affect the directions of muscle actions to the crank, thus changing the muscle recruitment pattern. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To optimize endurance cycling performance, it is important to maximize efficiency. Power-measuring cranks and force-sensing pedals can be used to determine the mechanical effectiveness of cycling. From both a coaching and basic science perspective, it is of interest if a mechanically effective pedaling technique leads to greater efficiency. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different pedaling techniques on mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency during steady-state cycling. METHODS: Eight male cyclists exercised on a cycle ergometer at 90 rpm and 200 W using four different pedaling techniques: preferred pedaling; pedaling in circles; emphasizing the pull during the upstroke; and emphasizing the push during the downstroke. Each exercise bout lasted 6 min and was interspersed with 6 min of passive rest. We obtained mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency using pedal-reaction forces and respiratory measures, respectively. RESULTS: When the participants were instructed to pull on the pedal during the upstroke, mechanical effectiveness was greater (index of force effectiveness=62.4+/-9.8{\%}) and gross efficiency was lower (gross efficiency=19.0+/-0.7{\%}) compared with the other pedaling conditions (index of force effectiveness=48.2+/-5.1{\%} and gross efficiency=20.2+/-0.6{\%}; means and standard deviations collapsed across preferred, circling, and pushing conditions). Mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency during the circling and pushing conditions did not differ significantly from the preferred pedaling condition. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical effectiveness is not indicative of gross efficiency across pedaling techniques. These results thereby provide coaches and athletes with useful information for interpreting measures of mechanical effectiveness.},

abstract = {Objective. The validity and reliability of a new prototype (PT) to measure tibio-calcaneal eversion/inversion, internal/external rotation, and plantar/dorsiflexion angle during running were investigated. Design. Test-retest measurements by a 3D accelerometer and gyroscope inertial motion unit (IMU) were compared to a motion capture (MC) based system both capturing in-shoe rearfoot and tibia kinematics. Background. Laboratory running tests may not reflect movement characteristics experienced during outdoor training. Lower extremity running kinematics have not been obtained by 3D IMU measurement within the shoe previously. Methods. 3D motion of two IMUs attached to the tibia and calcaneus, as well as retroreflective markers through windows in the running shoes, were determined during running. Intersegmental motion was extracted by a complementary filter fusing accelerometer data with integrated gyroscope angular velocity. PT measurements for motion along main anatomical axes were similar to MC derived curves based on coefficients of multiple correlation. Intraclass correlation correlations (ICC) showed a low correlation between PT and MC in three out of four parameters, but high repeatability for PT between test and retest measures. PT underestimated angular motion with a root mean square error (RMSe) of 182.5??/s and bias of 176.3??/s. Eversion was underestimated by PT with RMSe of 6.3??. The PT method was found inadequate to determine valid tibio-calcaneal motion while it was reliable for repeated tests and may allow for intra-subject comparisons of different footwear or inserts. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Cyclists are able to connect their cycling-shoes to pedals by the developed load cells. The sizes of load cells were almost same as plastic cleats (Shimano Corp) and measure the magnitude and direction of right and left pedal force using 16-strain gages, respectively. The analytical system solves the link model of human limbs to identify the positions and angles of each segment of lower limbs. The lower limbs model consisted of 3 segments, thigh, shank and foot. All position of every lower limb segments, joint torques and forces were calculated by this system. Additionally, the relationships between ankle angle and crank angle were also modelled by image-analysis software (TEMA 3D) with the high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM SA4).

abstract = {Professional cycle racing is one of the most demanding of all sports combining extremes of exercise duration, intensity and frequency. Riders are required to perform on a variety of surfaces (track, road, cross-country, mountain), terrains (level, uphill and downhill) and race situations (criterions, sprints, time trials, mass-start road races) in events ranging in duration from 10 s to 3 wk stage races covering 200 m to 4,000 km. Furthermore, professional road cyclists typically have approximately 100 race d/yr. Because of the diversity of cycle races, there are vastly different physiological demands associated with the various events. Until recently there was little information on the demands of professional cycling during training or competition. However, with the advent of reliable, valid bicycle crank dynanometers, it is now possible to quantify real-time power output, cadence and speed during a variety of track and road cycling races. This article provides novel data on the physiological demands of professional and world-class amateur cyclists and characterises some of the physiological attributes necessary for success in cycling at the {\'{e}}lite level.},

abstract = {Stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) in human skeletal muscle gives unique possibilities to study normal and fatigued muscle function. The in vivo force measurement systems, buckle transducer technique and optic fiber technique, have revealed that, as compared to a pure concentric action, a non-fatiguing SSC exercise demonstrates considerable performance enhancement with increased force at a given shortening velocity. Characteristic to this phenomenon is very low EMG-activity in the concentric phase of the cycle, but a very pronounced contribution of the short-latency stretch-reflex component. This reflex contributes significantly to force generation during the transition (stretch-shortening) phase in SSC action such as hopping and running. The amplitude of the stretch reflex component - and the subsequent force enhancement - may vary according to the increased stretch-load but also to the level of fatigue. While moderate SSC fatigue may result in slight potentiation, the exhaustive SSC fatigue can dramatically reduce the same reflex contribution. SSC fatigue is a useful model to study the processes of reversible muscle damage and how they interact with muscle mechanics, joint and muscle stiffness. All these parameters and their reduction during SSC fatigue changes stiffness regulation through direct influences on muscle spindle (disfacilitation), and by activating III and IV afferent nerve endings (proprioseptic inhibition). The resulting reduced stretch reflex sensitivity and muscle stiffness deteriorate the force potentiation mechanisms. Recovery of these processes is long lasting and follows the bimodal trend of recovery. Direct mechanical disturbances in the sarcomere structural proteins, such as titin, may also occur as a result of an exhaustive SSC exercise bout. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Within the frame of our study, we carried out two outdoor experiments. In the first experiment, we compared real and subjectively perceived physical strain during two test rides in mountainous terrain - with and without electrical support. The actual physical strain is deduced from the heart rate and lactate, whereas subjectively perceived exertion is estimated using the Borg Scale. In the second experiment we measured the muscle activity of the thighs over crank cycles during rides with different electric bicycles (rear-wheel drive and mid-mounted motor). This resulted in three hypotheses: with higher load the influence of the electrical assistance increases; the positioning of the electrical assistance does not affect the points in time of muscle activity; the positioning of the electrical assistance affects the amount of the muscle activity. Our goal is to get a better understanding of the behaviour of the physical strain during bicycle rides and the influence of electrical assistance on the riders' physiology. In addition, we aim to use this knowledge to improve the prediction of the required power support and to enhance the existing support strategies for the assistance. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

The sampling frequency was established as optimal in specifically designed assessment tests. The data is post-processed to determine the frequency responses, maximum accelerations and strains and to illustrate the time behaviour of accelerations and strains.

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the neuromuscular modifications of cyclists to changes in grade and posture. Eight subjects were tested on a computerized ergometer under three conditions with the same work rate (250 W): pedaling on the level while seated, 8{\%} uphill while seated, and 8{\%} uphill while standing (ST). High-speed video was taken in conjunction with surface electromyography (EMG) of six lower extremity muscles. Results showed that rectus femoris, gluteus maximus (GM), and tibialis anterior had greater EMG magnitude in the ST condition. GM, rectus femoris, and the vastus lateralis demonstrated activity over a greater portion of the crank cycle in the ST condition. The muscle activities of gastrocnemius and biceps femoris did not exhibit profound differences among conditions. Overall, the change of cycling grade alone from 0 to 8{\%} did not induce a significant change in neuromuscular coordination. However, the postural change from seated to ST pedaling at 8{\%} uphill grade was accompanied by increased and/or prolonged muscle activity of hip and knee extensors. The observed EMG activity patterns were discussed with respect to lower extremity joint moments. Monoarticular extensor muscles (GM, vastus lateralis) demonstrated greater modifications in activity patterns with the change in posture compared with their biarticular counterparts. Furthermore, muscle coordination among antagonist pairs of mono- and biarticular muscles was altered in the ST condition; this finding provides support for the notion that muscles within these antagonist pairs have different functions.},

abstract = {Walking is often modeled as an inverted pendulum system in which the center of mass vaults over the rigid stance limb. Running is modeled as a simple spring-mass system in which the center of mass bounces along on the compliant stance limb. In these models, differences in stance-limb behavior lead to nearly opposite patterns of vertical movements of the center of mass in the two gaits. Our goal was to quantify the importance of stance-limb behavior and other factors in determining the trajectory of the center of mass during walking and running. We collected kinematic and force platform data during human walking and running. Virtual stance-limb compression (i.e. reduction in the distance between the point of foot-ground contact and the center of mass during the first half of the stance phase) was only 26{\%} lower for walking (0.091 m) than for running (0.123 m) at speeds near the gait transition speed. In spite of this relatively small difference, the center of mass moved upwards by 0.031 m during the first half of the stance phase during walking and moved downwards by 0.073 m during the first half of the stance phase during running. The most important reason for this difference was that the stance limb swept through a larger angle during walking (30.4 degrees) than during running (19.2 degrees). We conclude that stance-limb touchdown angle and virtual stance-limb compression both play important roles in determining the trajectory of the center of mass and whether a gait is a walk or a run.},

The first part of the review depicts methodological aspects of the EMG signal recording and processing. We show how the pattern of muscle activation during pedaling can be analyzed in terms of muscle activity level and muscle activation timing. Muscle activity level is generally quantified with root mean square or integrated EMG values. Muscle activation timing is studied by defining EMG signal onset and offset times that identify the duration of EMG bursts and, more recently, by the determination of a lag time maximizing the cross-correlation coefficient. In the second part of the review, we describe whether the patterns of the lower limb muscles activity are influenced by numerous factors affecting pedaling such as power output, pedaling rate, body position, shoe-pedal interface, training status and fatigue. Some research perspectives linked to pedaling performance are discussed throughout the manuscript and in the conclusion. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cycling power decreases substantially during a maximal cycling trial of just 30 s. It is not known whether movement patterns and joint powers produced at each joint decrease to a similar extent or if each joint exhibits an individual fatigue profile. Changes in movement patterns and/or joint powers associated with overall task fatigue could arise from several different mechanisms or from a complex interplay of these mechanisms. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the changes in movement and power at each joint during a fatiguing cycling trial. Thirteen trained cyclists performed a 30 s maximal cycling trial on an isokinetic cycle ergometer at 120 rpm. Pedal forces and limb kinematics were recorded. Joint powers were calculated using a sagittal plane inverse dynamics model and averaged for the initial, middle, and final three second intervals of the trial, and normalized to initial values. Relative ankle plantar flexion power was significantly less than all other joint actions at the middle interval (51??5{\%} of initial power; p=0.013). Relative ankle plantar flexion power for the final interval (37??3{\%}) was significantly less than the relative knee flexion and hip extension power (p=0.010). Relative knee extension power (41??5{\%}) was significantly less than relative hip extension power (55??4{\%}) during the final three second interval (p=0.045). Knee flexion power (47??5{\%}) did not differ from relative hip extension power (p=0.06). These changes in power were accompanied by a decrease in time spent extending by each joint with fatigue (i.e., decreased duty cycle, p{\textless}0.03). While central mechanisms may have played a role across all joints, because the ankle fatigued more than the hip and knee joints, either peripheral muscle fatigue or changes in motor control strategies were identified as the potential mechanisms for joint-specific fatigue during a maximal 30 s cycling trial. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop an instrument for quantifying the motion of the hip relative to the bicycle while cycling in the standing position. Because of the need to measure hip motion on the road as well as in the laboratory, a goniometer which locates the hip using spherical coordinates was designed. The goniometer is presented first, followed by the development of the equations that enable the distance from the joint center to the pedal spindle to be determined. The orientation of this line segment is specified by calculating two angles referenced to the frame. Also outlined are the procedures used to both calibrate the goniometer and perform an accuracy check. The results of this check indicate that the attachment point of the goniometer to the rider can be located to within 2.5 mm of the true position. The goniometer was used to record the hip movement patterns of six subjects who cycled in the standing position on a treadmill. Representative results from one test subject who cycled at 6{\%} grade and 25 km h-1 are presented. Results indicate that the bicycle is leaned from side to side with the frequency of leaning equal to the frequency of pedalling. Extreme lean angles are ??6??. The distance from the hip to the pedal varies approximately sinusoidally with frequency equal to pedalling rate and amplitude somewhat less than crank arm length. The absolute elevation of the hip, however, exhibits two cycles for each crank cycle. Asymmetry in the plot of elevation over a single crank cycle indicates that the pelvis rocks from side to side and that the elevation of the pelvis midpoint changes. Extreme values of the pelvis rocking angle are ??12??. Highest pelvis midpoint elevations, however, do not occur at the same crank angles as those angles at which the pelvis rocking is extreme. It appears that the vertical motion of the hips affects pedalling mechanics when cycling in the standing position.},

The following hypotheses were therefore tested: (1) the standing position results in better performance at a high power output, while (2) the seated position is best at a moderate power output. We also assessed the seated-standing transition intensity, above which seated cycling should be superseded by standing cycling for maximization of performance. Ten male cyclists (mean age 27 years, s = 3; height 1.82 m, s = 0.07; body mass 75.2 kg, s = 7.0; VO2max 70.0 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), s = 5.2) performed seated and standing treadmill cycling to exhaustion at 10{\%} grade and at four power outputs ranging from 86{\%} to 165{\%} of their power output at maximal oxygen uptake (Wmax). Power output at maximal oxygen uptake was obtained during determination of VO2max. There was no difference in time to exhaustion between the two cycling positions at 86{\%} of Wmax (P = 0.29). All participants performed best at the highest power output (165{\%} of Wmax) when standing (P = 0.002). An overall seated-standing transition intensity of 94{\%} of Wmax was identified. Thus, in general, cyclists may choose either the standing or seated position for maximization of performance at a submaximal intensity of 86{\%} of Wmax, while the standing position should be used at intensities above 94{\%} of Wmax and approaching 165{\%} of Wmax.},

abstract = {Cyclists seek to maximize performance during competition, and gross efficiency is an important factor affecting performance. Gross efficiency is itself affected by pedal rate. Thus, it is important to understand factors that affect freely chosen pedal rate. Crank inertial load varies greatly during road cycling based on the selected gear ratio. Nevertheless, the possible influence of crank inertial load on freely chosen pedal rate and gross efficiency has never been investigated. This study tested the hypotheses that during cycling with sub-maximal work rates, a considerable increase in crank inertial load would cause (1) freely chosen pedal rate to increase, and as a consequence, (2) gross efficiency to decrease. Furthermore, that it would cause (3) peak crank torque to increase if a constant pedal rate was maintained. Subjects cycled on a treadmill at 150 and 250W, with low and high crank inertial load, and with preset and freely chosen pedal rate. Freely chosen pedal rate was higher at high compared with low crank inertial load. Notably, the change in crank inertial load affected the freely chosen pedal rate as much as did the 100W increase in work rate. Along with freely chosen pedal rate being higher, gross efficiency at 250W was lower during cycling with high compared with low crank inertial load. Peak crank torque was higher during cycling at 90rpm with high compared with low crank inertial load. Possibly, the subjects increased the pedal rate to compensate for the higher peak crank torque accompanying cycling with high compared with low crank inertial load.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Cycling is commonly prescribed for knee osteoarthritis, but previous literature on biomechanics during cycling and the effects of acute intervention on osteoarthritis patients does not exist. Due to their altered knee kinematics, osteoarthritis patients may be at greater risk of osteoarthritis progression or other knee injuries during cycling. This study investigated the effects of reduced foot progression (toe-in) angles on knee joint biomechanics in subjects with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Methods Thirteen osteoarthritis and 11 healthy subjects participated in this study. A motion analysis system and custom instrumented pedal was used to collect 5 pedal cycles of kinematic and kinetic data in 1 neutral and 2 toe-in conditions (5 and 10) at 60 RPM and 80 W. Findings For peak knee adduction angle, there was a 61{\%} (2.7) and a 73{\%} (3.2) decrease in the 5 and 10 toe-in conditions compared to neutral in the osteoarthritis group and a 77{\%} (1.7) and 109{\%} (2.4) decrease in the healthy group for the 5 and 10 conditions, respectively. This finding was not accompanied by a decrease in pain or peak knee abduction moment. A simple linear regression showed a positive correlation between Kelgren-Lawrence score and both peak knee adduction angle and abduction moment. Interpretation For individuals who cycle with increased knee adduction angles, decreasing the foot progression angle may be beneficial for reducing the risk of overuse knee injuries during cycling by resulting in a frontal plane knee alignment closer to a neutral position.},

abstract = {The primary purpose of this project was to examine whether lower extremity joint kinetic factors are related to the walk-run gait transition during human locomotion. Following determination of the preferred transition speed (PTS), each of the 16 subjects walked down a 25-m runway, and over a floor-mounted force platform at five speeds (70, 80, 90, 100, and 110{\%} of the PTS), and ran over the force platform at three speeds (80, 100, and 120{\%} of the PTS) while being videotaped (240 Hz) from the right sagittal plane. Two-dimensional kinematic data were synchronized with ground reaction force data (960 Hz). After smoothing, ankle and knee joint moments and powers were calculated using standard inverse dynamics calculations. The maximum dorsiflexor moment was the only variable tested that increased as walking speed increased and then decreased when gait changed to a run at the PTS, meeting the criteria set to indicate that this variable influences the walk-run gait transition during human locomotion. This supports previous research suggesting that an important factor in changing gaits at the PTS is the prevention of undue stress in the dorsiflexor muscles.},

abstract = {This study compared the conventional parameters of anaerobic cycling power in physically active non-cyclists using the Pro-Race{\textregistered} system and a traditional chainring. The force-velocity test was chosen for this purpose because it is the shortest validated cycling laboratory test in which each parameter of maximal anaerobic power can be estimated. The power output (Wmax) and the force at which Wmax is produced (Fopt) were significantly improved with the eccentric chainring (1100 ± 227 W versus 1006 ± 197 W and 1.39 ± 0.15 N/kg body mass versus 1.13 ± 0.16 N/kg body mass with the eccentric and round designs, respectively; P {\textless} 0.006 and P {\textless} 0.0004, respectively). The power gained (delta power) was significantly correlated with the eccentric chainring Fopt (r = 0.649; P {\textless} 0.05), the mid-thigh circumference (r = 0.685; P {\textless} 0.05), the estimated lean thigh volume (r = 0.765; P {\textless} 0.01) and the estimated lean lower limb volume (r = 0.665; P {\textless} 0.05). We concluded that the eccentric chainring significantly improved the estimated anaerobic power output during a force-velocity test by increasing the force component, Fopt. Cautious interpretation of our results suggests that the subjects with physical attributes that contribute to developing high forces may have a significant advantage in performing with the eccentric chainring. {\textcopyright} 2007 Sports Medicine Australia.},

Together with the subjective evaluation test sessions, a set of engineering indexes, representing the most representative technical measurements of the cyclists perceived performance requirements, is also needed for an effective product innovation approach. Aim of the present work was the development of a method for the computation of a wheel reactivity engineering index. The method is based on the computation of the energy absorbed by the wheel during a sprint action performed by the cyclist. Each energy contribution to the total energy absorbed by the wheel was quantified; the parameters considered for the index computation were obtained by the analysis of data collected in the field tests of an instrumented bicycle. The high correlation coefficient obtained between the engineering reactivity index calculated for three different wheels and the perceived reactivity evaluated by the cyclists, regarding the same wheels, was considered as a validation of the developed method. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study assessed whether an eccentric chainring that increases crank arm length at the downstroke and decreases it during the upstroke improves performance in a track cycling event: the 1000 m time trial. It also determined whether selected physical and physiological variables and the velocity profile are associated with eccentric chainring performance. Twelve cyclists performed an outdoor 1000 m time trial on a 333 m banked, cement-surfaced track using two different chainrings, round and eccentric, in randomised order. The important findings of this study were that (1) performance did not significantly differ between chainrings; (2) neither the physiological variables (lactate and heart rate) nor the velocity profile (lap times) were affected by use of the eccentric design; (3) when time was saved with the eccentric chainring, it was significantly correlated with estimated lower limb muscle volume (r = -0.605), circumference (r = -0.739), estimated calf muscle volume (r = -0.772) and cross-sectional area (r = -0.745). Moreover, estimated lower limb muscle volume (r = -0.703), estimated calf muscle volume (r = -0.772) and cross-sectional area (r = -0.871) significantly predicted performance with the eccentric chainring. The physical variables associated with eccentric chainring performance were muscle anthropometric parameters. We have interpreted our results cautiously and suggest that the subjects who had greater lower limb muscle volume and greater calf muscle volume, seem to have had a significant advantage in performing with the eccentric chainring. Further testing with track specialists performing at national or international level would be helpful to define the maximal possibilities of this chainring. ?? 2006 Sports Medicine Australia.},

Therefore, understanding movement behavior during uphill cycling is needed in order to find an optimum solution that can be applied in practice. The aim of this review is to assess the quality of research performed on biomechanics and the energetics of uphill cycling. Altogether we have analyzed over 40 articles from scientific and expert periodicals that provided results on . energetics, pedal and joint forces, economy and efficiency, muscular activity, as well as performance and comfort optimization during uphill cycling. During uphill cycling, cyclists need to overcome gravity and in order to achieve this, some changes in posture are necessary. The main results from this review are that changes in muscular activity are present, while on the other hand pedal forces, joint dynamics, and cycling efficiency are not substantially altered during seated uphill cycling compared to cycling on level terrain. In contrast, during standing uphill cycling, all of the previously mentioned measures are different when comparing either seated uphill cycling or level terrain cycling.

abstract = {Despite the many reviews and research papers on the limitations of surface electromyography (EMG), there are relatively few that address this issue by considering dynamic contractions and specifically from the point of view of muscle coordination. Nevertheless, whether muscle coordination can be precisely studied using surface EMG signals is still a matter of discussion in the scientific community. In other words, it is uncertain whether neural control strategies of movement can be inferred from EMG. This review article discusses the appropriateness of using EMG recordings for studying muscle coordination. First, the main uses of surface EMG for studying muscle coordination are depicted. Then, the main intrinsic drawbacks of the EMG technique (i.e., amplitude cancellation, crosstalk and spatial variability of muscle activity) and of EMG processing (i.e., smoothing of the linear envelope, normalization of the time scale and the amplitude and timing of muscle activation) are described and discussed. Finally, three other factors (i.e., variability, electromechanical delay and neuromuscular fatigue), which can affect the interpretation of EMG and have received little attention in the literature, are presented and discussed. All of this information is crucial to the proper interpretation of muscle coordination from EMG signals. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We examined the influence of cadence in cycling technique by quantifying phase relationships for a number of important variables at the crank and lower extremity joints. Any difference in the effect of cadence on force, effectiveness, and power phases would indicate an essential change in coordination pattern. Cycle kinetics was recorded for 10 male competitive cyclists at five cadences (60-100 rpm) at submaximal load (260 W). Joint powers were calculated using inverse dynamics methods. All data were expressed as a function of crank position. The phase of the crank mechanical profiles (total force, crank and joint power, and effectiveness) was calculated using four methods: crank angle of maximum (MA) and minimum (MI), fitting a sine wave (SI) and by cross-correlation (XC). These methods, apart from the MA method, showed the same relative phase. The variables, however, showed different phases being expressed as time lag: force effectiveness: 0.131 (±0.034) s; total force: 0.149 (±0.021) s; power: 0.098 (±0.027) s. The phases in joint powers hip 0.071 (±0.008), knee 0.082 (±0.009), and hip 0.077 (±0.012) were only well described by XC, and were somewhat lower than the crank power phase. These differences indicate the potential effect of inertia of the lower limb in phase shifts from joints to crank.

abstract = {This study compared patterns of leg muscle recruitment and coactivation, and the relationship between muscle recruitment, coactivation and cadence, in novice and highly trained cyclists. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and soleus (SOL) was recorded using intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. Four experimental conditions of varying cadence were investigated. Differences were evident between novice and highly trained cyclists in the recruitment of all muscles. Novice cyclists were characterized by greater individual variance, greater population variance, more extensive and more variable muscle coactivation, and greater EMG amplitude in periods between primary EMG bursts. Peak EMG amplitude increased linearly with cadence and was not different at individual preferred cadence in either novice or highly trained cyclists. However, EMG amplitude in periods between primary EMG bursts, as well as the duration of primary EMG bursts, increased with increasing cadence in novice cyclists but were not influenced by cadence in highly trained cyclists. Our findings suggest that muscle recruitment is highly skilled in highly trained cyclists and less refined in novice cyclists. More skilled muscle recruitment in highly trained cyclists is likely a result of neuromuscular adaptations due to repeated performance of the cycling movement in training and competition. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Performance in endurance events is typically evaluated by the power or velocity that can be maintained for durations of 30 min. to four hours. The two main by-products of intense and prolonged oxidative metabolism that can limit performance are the accumulation of hydrogen ion (i.e. lactic acidosis) and heat (i.e. hyperthermia). A model for endurance performance is presented that revolves around identification of the lactate threshold velocity which is presented as a function of numerous morphological components as well as gross mechanical efficiency. When cycling at 80 RPM, gross mechanical efficiency is positively related to Type I muscle fiber composition, which has great potential to improve endurance performance. Endurance performance can also be influenced by altering the availability of oxygen and blood glucose during exercise. The latter need forms the basis for ingesting carbohydrate at 30-60 grams per hour during exercise. In laboratory simulations of performance, athletes fatigue due to hyperthermia when esophageal is approximately 40 degrees C, in association with near maximal heart rate and perceived exertion. It is likely that the central nervous system is involved in the aetiology of fatigue from hyperthermia. Dehydration during exercise promotes hyperthermia by reducing skin blood flow, sweating rate and thus heat dissipation. The combination of dehydration and hyperthermia during exercise causes large reductions in cardiac output and blood flow to the exercising musculature, and thus has a large potential to impair endurance performance. Endurance performance is optimized when training is aimed specifically at developing individual components of the model presented and nutritional supplementation prevents hypoglycemia and attenuates dehydration and hyperthermia. Indeed, the challenge at the transition to a new millennium is to synergistically integrate these physiological factors in training and competition.},

abstract = {Assessment of intra-session repeatability of muscle activation pattern is of considerable relevance for research settings, especially when used to determine changes over time. However, the repeatability of lower limb muscles activation pattern during pedaling is not fully established. Thus, we tested the intra-session repeatability of the activation pattern of 10 lower limb muscles during a sub-maximal cycling exercise. Eleven triathletes participated to this study. The experimental session consisted in a reference sub-maximal cycling exercise (i.e. 150 W) performed before and after a 53-min simulated training session (mean power output = 200 ?? 12 W). Repeatability of EMG patterns was assessed in terms of muscle activity level (i.e. RMS of the mean pedaling cycle and burst) and muscle activation timing (i.e. onset and offset of the EMG burst) for the 10 following lower limb muscles: gluteus maximus (GMax), semimembranosus (SM), Biceps femoris (BF), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius medianus (GM) and lateralis (GL), soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA). No significant differences concerning the muscle activation level were found between test and retest for all the muscles investigated. Only VM, SOL and TA showed significant differences in muscle activation timing parameters. Whereas ICC and SEM values confirmed this weak repeatability, cross-correlation coefficients suggest a good repeatability of the activation timing parameters for all the studied muscles. Overall, the main finding of this work is the good repeatability of the EMG pattern during pedaling both in term of muscle activity level and muscle activation timing. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The model simulates two standard loading conditions to understand the vertical compliance and lateral stiffness characteristics of 82 existing bicycle frames from the bicycle geometry project and compares these characteristics to an optimised solution in these conditions. Perhaps unsurprisingly smaller frames (490mm seat tube) behave the most favourably in terms of both vertical compliance and lateral stiffness, while the shorter top tube length (525mm) and larger head tube angle (74.5??) results in a laterally stiffer frame which corresponds with findings from literature. The optimised values show a considerable improvement over the best of the existing frames, with a 13{\%} increase in vertical displacement and 15{\%} decrease in lateral displacement when compared to the best of the analysed frames.

Little if any information is available on the effect of the geographical environment on the neuromuscular control of an athlete or workman during his/her performance or effort.Motions were chosen in Alpine skiing and cycling.Thirty-one certified ski instructors and twelve professional road cyclists participated in the study of geographical variance and its impact on muscle activity.SEMG was measured from the agonists and antagonists of the upper- and lower limb. Skiers were measured on downhill slopes ranging from 19 to 51{\%} while the cyclists performed with different saddle positions on 2, 7 and 12{\%} slope inclinations, respectively.Verification of the variation of muscular intensity (IEMG) over the slope inclination during a simulated giant slalom indicated that the muscular activity increased with increasing slope angle and decreased with decreasing slope angle, while heart rate measured with short-range radio telemetry increased at a constant rate between start and finish independent of the geographical variations.In a direct descent on different slopes {\%} levels the integrated EMG is well related to the inclination (r=0.82) confirming the findings of the giant slalom.In cycling we found that, regardless of the pelvis position, the muscular intensity of lower limb muscles increased with increasing slope inclination, while the muscular intensity of the arms decreased with the same increasing slope inclination. In addition the decreased intensity of the arm muscles remained significantly higher with the pelvis (saddle) fully forward.The geography of the terrain did influence the neuromuscular work and therewith probably the performance also. The influence however, varies with specific circumstances and is coupled with items of variability of the equipment used and the body regions involved. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Seven mountain-bike trained cyclists completed two incremental maximal tests, separated by 48. h, one for each crank system. Each test started with a workload of 100. W and was increased by 30.

EMG was compared using a general linear model considering as factors the crank system and workload with post hoc analysis at ??=0.05. RMS presented effect of workload, but no effect of crank system was found for the muscles analyzed.

abstract = {To maintain a stable, upright posture, the central nervous system (CNS) must integrate sensory information from multiple sources and subsequently generate corrective plantar flexor torque about the ankle joint. Although proprioceptive information from the muscles that cross this joint has been shown to be vital in this process, the specific source of this information remains questionable. Recent research on this topic has been focused on the potential role of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle during standing, largely due to the lack of modulation of its activity throughout the sway cycle. Ten young, healthy subjects were asked to stand normally under varying conditions, for periods of 60s. During these trials, intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) activity and the fascicle length of three distinct anatomical regions of TA were sampled synchronously with kinematic data regarding sway position. In the quiet standing conditions, TA muscle activity was unmodulated and fascicle length changes in each region were tightly coupled with changes in sway position. In the active sway condition, more EMG activity was observed in TA and the fascicle length changes were decoupled from sway position. The ability of the TA fascicles to follow sway position further enhances the idea that TA is well placed to provide accurate, straightforward sensory information to the CNS regarding sway position. It is also likely that, through reciprocal inhibition, afferent information from TA could help to regulate plantar flexor torque at relevant phases of the sway cycle. The proprioceptive role of TA appears to become more complicated during more challenging conditions.},

Eight competitive cyclists (age 27+/-7 years; body mass 73.2+/-5.2 kg; height 177+/-6 cm; mean +/- s) completed six tests in random order: a lactate minimum test; a Wingate anaerobic power test; and two 6-km climbs at 6{\%} and two 1-km climbs at 12{\%} gradient performed on a motorized treadmill. The mean times and power outputs for the 6-km and 1-km climbs were 16:30+/-1:08 min: s and 330+/-17.8 W, and 4:19+/-0:27 min: s and 411+/-24.4 W, respectively. The best individual predictor of 6-km and 1-km performance times was the time for the corresponding climb at the other distance (r = 0.97). The next strongest predictor of both hill climb performances was the average power produced during the Wingate test divided by body mass. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the two variables contributing most to the prediction equation for both climbs were the Wingate average power per unit of body mass and maximal aerobic power divided by total mass (rider + bike), which together accounted for 92 and 96{\%} of the variability in the 6-km and 1-km climbs. In conclusion, among competitive cyclists, the Wingate average power per unit of body mass was the best single predictor of simulated cycling hill climb performance at the distance and gradient used.},

Subsequently the boards were prepared with a racing finish and the friction coefficient of the boards was measured again. The effects of base structure and wax on the kinetic friction on snow appear to be strongly interdependent. A wax that takes effect on one board at given conditions must not be working on a board with different base structure. In addition there is a strong influence of the sliding speed. Optimization of race equipment must not only consider the interdependency of base structure and wax but also the relevant competition speed. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Ten male cyclists completed 9. ×. 5. min of cycling at 3 seat heights and 3 cadences. Three-dimensional leg kinematics and muscle activation patterns were recorded to estimate timing of eccentric muscle contractions. Onset, offset and duration of eccentric contractions and, onset, offset and duration of muscle activation were calculated, along with cycling economy. Duration of GAST and VL eccentric contractions decreased with increasing seat height due to earlier offset of eccentric muscle contractions. Duration of BF eccentric contractions significantly increased with seat height due to a later eccentric contraction offset. Offset of GAST and BF muscle activation occurred earlier with increasing cadence. Cycling economy was significantly affected by cadence but not seat height. The results suggest that as a consequence of altered seat height, proprioceptive feedback is used to fine-tune the timing of bi-articular eccentric muscle contractions.

abstract = {An isometric maximal voluntary contraction (iMVC) is mostly used for the purpose of EMG normalization, a procedure described in the scientific literature in order to compare muscle activity among different muscles and subjects. However, the use of iMVC has certain limitations. The aims of the present study were therefore to propose a new method for the purpose of EMG amplitude normalization in cycling and assess its reliability. Twenty-three cyclists performed 10 trials of a maximal isokinetic protocol (MIP) on a cycle ergometer, then another four sub-maximal trials, whilst the EMG activity of four lower limbs muscles was registered. During the 10 trials power output (CV = 2.19) and EMG activity (CV between 4.46 and 8.70) were quite steady. Furthermore, their maximal values were reached within the 4th trial. In sub-maximal protocol EMG activity exhibited an increase as a function of exercise intensity. MIP entails a maximal dynamic contraction of the muscles involved in the pedalling action and the normalization session is performed under the same biomechanical conditions as the following test session. Thus, it is highly cycling-specific. MIP has good logical validity and within-subject reproducibility. Three trials are enough for the purpose of EMG normalization in cycling. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cycling is generally regarded as a low impact sport. It has a range of skills and disciplines, but the majority of cyclists are usually involved in the endurance aspect of the sport. The low impact nature, however, does not preclude cyclists from injury and musculoskeletal problems. Apart from the obvious trauma and sequelae involved in a fall from the bike, the prolonged postural adaptations combined with the repetitive limb movement from spending hours cycling seem to be one of the main reasons for lower limb and lower body problems. Those intending to become involved in the diagnosis and treatment of such problems should be aware of the plethora of mechanical and biomechanical issues when assessing an injured cyclist. This review of lower body problems in cycling highlights the typical patterns of injury and points out that to obtain a diagnosis for a cycling related problem a practitioner must evaluate faults in the bicycle as well as the cyclist. It also highlights that, despite some useful biomechanical input, there is a disturbing lack of evidence base for the treatment of some musculoskeletal complaints. This is unhelpful to those seeking more evidence-based practice, and may encourage an anecdotal approach to treatment for cyclists. All practitioners who are involved in the care of these sports people should continue to press for good quality studies so that cycling injuries of the lower limb may treated more efficaciously in the future. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The lack of research is partly due to the difficulties in obtaining data in the field. The aim of this study was to analyse the crank torque in road cycling on level and uphill using different pedalling cadences in the seated position. Seven male cyclists performed four tests in the seated position (1) on level ground at 80 and 100rpm, and (2) on uphill road cycling (9.25{\%} grade) at 60 and 80rpm.The cyclists exercised for 1min at their maximal aerobic power. The bicycle was equipped with the SRM Training System (Schoberer, Germany) for the measurement of power output (W), torque (Nm), pedalling cadence (rpm), and cycling velocity (kmh-1). The most important finding of this study indicated that at maximal aerobic power the crank torque profile (relationship between torque and crank angle) varied substantially according to the pedalling cadence and with a minor effect according to the terrain. At the same power output and pedalling cadence (80rpm) the torque at a 45??crank angle tended (p{\textless}0.06) to be higher (+26{\%}) during uphill cycling compared to level cycling. During uphill cycling at 60rpm the peak torque was increased by 42{\%} compared with level ground cycling at 100rpm.When the pedalling cadence was modified, most of the variations in the crank torque profile were localised in the power output sector (45??to 135??). ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Gravity is a contributing force that is believed to influence strongly the control of limb movements since it affects sensory input and also contributes to task mechanics. By altering the relative contribution of gravitational force to the overall forces used to control pedaling at different body orientations, we tested the hypothesis that joint torque and muscle activation patterns would be modified to generate steady-state pedaling at altered body orientations. Eleven healthy subjects pedaled a modified ergometer at different body orientations (from horizontal to vertical), maintaining the same workload (80 J), cadence (60 rpm), and hip and knee kinematics. Pedal reaction forces and crank and pedal kinematics were measured and used to calculate joint torques and angles. EMG was recorded from four muscles (tibialis anterior, triceps surae, rectus femoris, biceps femoris). Measures of muscle activation (joint torque and EMG activity) showed strong dependence on body orientation, indicating that muscle activity is not fixed and is modified in response to altered body orientation. Simulations confirmed that, while joint torque changes were not necessary to pedal at different body orientations, observed changes were necessary to maintain consistent crank angular velocity profiles. Dependence of muscle activity on body orientation may be due to neural integration of sensory information with an internal model that includes characteristics of the endpoint, to produce consistent pedaling trajectories. Thus, both sensory consequences and mechanical aspects of gravitational forces are important determinants of locomotor tasks such as pedaling.},

abstract = {Laboratory testing of cyclists is currently undertaken using turbo trainers or cycle ergometers. The benefits of laboratory testing are the ability to measure performance: (i) more accurately and repeatedly and (ii) under controlled conditions enabling, for example, video analysis to determine joint-specific power production or enable novel instrumentation to be applied to the bicycle, for example, to measure seat interface pressure. Influence of the bicycle fit on torque production have been presented by Irriberri et al(2008) and Peveler et al(2007). Market leading bicycle ergometer manufacturers, such as Lode and Monark, provide feedback on performance metrics including cadence and force measurement. However, neither ergometer provides real time adaptation of bicycle fit to the resolution (i.e. {\textless} mm precision) required by elite athletes or allows adjustments to position whilst cycling under simulated road / track conditions. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to demonstrate and provide initial validation results for a novel, fully automated cycle ergometer that incorporates faster, repeatable and more accurate adjustments to bicycle geometry. The ergometer also allows the cyclist to use their preferred handlebars and saddle to accommodate the different cycling disciplines, e.g. track, road, mountain and BMX. The ergometer enables fitting adjustments to be controlled whilst cycling and aims to reduce initial set-up times for different athletes to about 30 seconds as opposed to 30 minutes (required by the end-users current ergometer instantiations). Instrumented cranks have been fitted to monitor the torque and force generated by the crank movements in 2-axes through 360 degrees of crank motion. The ergometer can be coupled (via a user selectable clutch mechanism) to an AC servo motor within the drive chain which supports the application of models of bicycle performance to the ergometer to enable torque versus position versus speed profiles as derived from road and / or track trials to be readily mapped into the laboratory environment ?? 2014 The Authors.},

Seven male cyclists performed seven tests in seated position at different pedaling cadences: (a) in the laboratory at 60, 80, and 100 rpm; (b) on level terrain at 80 and 100 rpm; and (c) on uphill terrain (9.25{\%} grade) at 60 and 80 rpm.

The Monark ergometer and the bicycle were equipped with the SRM Training System (Schoberer, Germany) for the measurement of power output (W), torque (Nxm), pedaling cadence (rpm), and cycling velocity (kmxh-1). The most important findings of this study indicate that at maximal aerobic power the crank torque profiles in the Monark ergometer (818 E) were significantly different (especially on dead points of the crank cycle) and generate a higher perceived exertion compared with road cycling conditions.},

abstract = {In contraction of skeletal muscle a delay exists between the onset of electrical activity and measurable tension. This delay in electromechanical coupling has been stated to be between 30 and 100 ms. Thus, in rapid movements it may be possible for electromyographic (EMG) activity to have terminated before force can be detected. This study was designed to determine the dependence of the EMG-tension delay upon selected initial conditions at the time of muscle activation. The right forearms of 14 subjects were passively oscillated by a motor-driven dynamometer through flexion-extension cycles of 135 deg at an angular velocity of approximately equal to 0.5 rad/s. Upon presentation of a visual stimulus the subjects maximally contracted the relaxed elbow flexors during flexion, extension, and under isometric conditions. The muscle length at the time of the stimulus was the same in all three conditions. An on-line computer monitoring surface EMG (Biceps and Brachioradialis) and force calculated the electromechanical delay. The mean value for the delay under eccentric condition, 49.5 ms, was significantly different (p less than 0.05) from the delays during isometric (53.9 ms) and concentric activity (55.5 ms). It is suggested that the time required to stretch the series elastic component (SEC) represents the major portion of the measured delay and that during eccentric muscle activity the SEC is in a more favorable condition for rapid force development.},

The mean differences in range of motion of the dorsi- and plantarflexed technique from the control position were 7.1 +/- 4.4 and 6.9 +/- 5.4 degrees , respectively. Gastrocnemius EMG activity was higher with the dorsiflexion technique than when using the self-selected control position (33.2 +/- 13.0 and 24.2 +/- 8.4 microV s, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, GE was 2.6{\%} lower while riding with the dorsiflexion technique than the control position (19.0 +/- 1.2 and 19.5 +/- 1.3{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {The effects of upper body orientation on neuromuscular control of the leg during cycling are not well understood. Our aim was to investigate the effects of upper body orientation on control of movement of distal leg segments during cycling. We compared three-dimensional leg and foot kinematics and muscle recruitment patterns between upright and aerodynamic riding positions. Comparisons were made between 10 elite cyclists, 10 elite triathletes and 10 novice cyclists. We found that upper body orientation did not influence kinematics of the leg and foot or primary muscle activity (i.e., the main bursts of muscle activity). The aerodynamic riding position was, however, associated with less modulation of muscle activity (i.e., less relaxation of the muscle during secondary muscle activity) and greater coactivity in elite triathletes and novice cyclists. Our results suggest that orientation of the upper body influences neuromuscular control of the leg during cycling in elite triathletes and novice cyclists. The change in muscle recruitment (i.e., the change in how the goal movement was achieved) implies that the ability of the central nervous system to execute the cycling movement in the most skilled manner was adversely influenced by upper body orientation in elite triathletes and novice cyclists. Less modulation of muscle activity and greater coactivation in elite triathletes when cycling in the aerodynamic position, and the similarity of changes shown in elite triathletes and novice cyclists, may be interpreted as further evidence of less skilled control of movement in elite triathletes when compared to cyclists matched for cycling training history. ?? 2007 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of maximal strength capacity on muscle activation, during cycling, at three selected cadences: a low cadence (50 rpm), a high cadence (110 rpm) and the freely chosen cadence (FCC). Two groups of trained cyclists were selected on the basis of the different maximal isokinetic voluntary contraction values (MVCi) of their lower extremity muscles as follow: Fmin (lower MVCi group) and Fmax (higher MVCi group). All subjects performed three 4-min cycling exercises at a power output corresponding to 80{\%} of the ventilatory threshold under the three cadences. Neuromuscular activity of vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) was studied quantitatively (integrated electromyography, IEMG) and qualitatively (timing of muscle bursts during crank cycle). Cadence effects were observed on the EMG activity of VL muscle and on the burst onset of the BF, VL and RF muscles. A greater normalized EMG activity of VL muscle was observed for the Fmin group than the Fmax group at all cadences (respectively Fmin vs. Fmax at 50 rpm: 17 ± 5{\%} vs. 38 ± 6{\%}, FCC: 22 ± 7{\%} vs. 44 ± 5{\%} and 110 rpm: 21 ± 6{\%} vs. 45 ± 6{\%}). At FCC and 110 rpm, the burst onset of BF and RF muscles of the Fmax group started earlier in the crank cycle than the Fmin group These results indicate that in addition to the cadence, the maximal strength capacity influences the lower extremity muscular activity during cycling. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {On level ground, cycling is more economical than running, which in turn is more economical than walking in the high speed range. This paper investigates whether this ranking still holds when moving on a gradient, where the three modes are expected to be mainly facing the same burden, i.e. to counter gravity. By using data from the literature we have built a theoretical framework to predict the optimal mode as a function of the gradient. Cycling was found to be the mode of choice only below 10-15{\%} gradient, while above it walking was the least expensive locomotion type. Seven amateur bikers were then asked to walk, run and ride on a treadmill at different gradients. The speed was set so as to maintain almost constant the metabolic demand across the different gradients. The results indicate that the "critical slope", i.e. the one above which walking is less expensive than cycling (and running), is about 13-15{\%}. One subject was loaded during bipedal gaits with a bicycle-equivalent mass, to simulate to cross-country cycling situation. The critical slope was close to 20{\%}, due to the higher metabolic cost of loaded walking and running. Part of the findings can be explained by the mechanically different paradigms of the three locomotion types.},

abstract = {Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95{\%} likely range of change of an individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.},

Footwear mass, cushioning, and bending stiffness each affect the energetic cost of running. Recently, prototype running shoes were developed that combine a new highly compliant and resilient midsole material with a stiff embedded plate. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, these newly developed running shoes reduce the energetic cost of running compared with established marathon racing shoes. Methods: 18 high-caliber athletes ran six 5-min trials (three shoes × two replicates) in prototype shoes (NP), and two established marathon shoes (NS and AB) during three separate sessions: 14, 16, and 18 km/h. We measured submaximal oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production during minutes 3–5 and averaged energetic cost (W/kg) for the two trials in each shoe model. Results: Compared with the established racing shoes, the new shoes reduced the energetic cost of running in all 18 subjects tested. Averaged across all three velocities, the energetic cost for running in the NP shoes (16.45 ± 0.89 W/kg; mean ± SD) was 4.16 and 4.01{\%} lower than in the NS and AB shoes, when shoe mass was matched (17.16 ± 0.92 and 17.14 ± 0.97 W/kg, respectively, both p {\textless} 0.001). The observed percent changes were independent of running velocity (14–18 km/h). Conclusion: The prototype shoes lowered the energetic cost of running by 4{\%} on average. We predict that with these shoes, top athletes could run substantially faster and achieve the first sub-2-hour marathon.},

@article{Tesio2019,
abstract = {Human walking is usually conceived as the cyclic rotation of the limbs. The goal of lower-limb movements, however, is the forward translation of the body system, which can be mechanically represented by its center of mass (CoM). Lower limbs act as struts of an inverted pendulum, allowing minimization of muscle work, from infancy to old age. The plantar flexors of the trailing limbs have been identified as the main engines of CoM propulsion. Motion of the CoM can be investigated through refined techniques, but research has been focused on the fields of human and animal physiology rather than clinical medicine. Alterations in CoM motion could reveal motor impairments that are not detectable by clinical observation. The study of the three-dimensional trajectory of the CoM motion represents a clinical frontier. After adjusting for displacement due to the average forward speed, the trajectory assumes a figure-eight shape (dubbed the “bow-tie”) with a perimeter about 18 cm long. Its lateral size decreases with walking velocity, thus ensuring dynamic stability. Lateral redirection appears as a critical phase of the step, requiring precise muscle sequencing. The shape and size of the “bow-tie” as functions of dynamically equivalent velocities do not change from child to adulthood, despite anatomical growth. The trajectory of the CoM thus appears to be a promising summary index of both balance and the neural maturation of walking. In asymmetric gaits, the affected lower limb avoids muscle work by pivoting almost passively, but extra work is required from the unaffected side during the next step, in order to keep the body system in motion. Generally, the average work to transport the CoM across a stride remains normal. In more demanding conditions, such as walking faster or uphill, the affected limb can actually provide more work; however, the unaffected limb also provides more work and asymmetry between the steps persists. This learned or acquired asymmetry is a formerly unsuspected challenge to rehabilitation attempts to restore symmetry. Techniques of selective loading of the affected side, which include constraining the motion of the unaffected limb or forcing the use of the affected limb on split-belt treadmills which impose a different velocity and power to either limb, are now under scrutiny.},

abstract = {Purpose: Motor impairments affect functional abilities and gait in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). Improving their walking is an essential objective of treatment, and the use of a treadmill for gait analysis and training could offer several advantages in adolescents with CP. However, there is a controversy regarding the similarity between treadmill and overground walking both for gait analysis and training in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to compare the external mechanical work and pendular energy transduction of these two types of gait modalities at standard and preferred walking speeds in adolescents with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) and typically developing (TD) adolescents matched on age, height and body mass. Methods: Spatiotemporal parameters, external mechanical work and pendular energy transduction of walking were computed using two inertial sensors equipped with a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope and compared in 10 UCP (14.2 ± 1.7 year) and 10 TD (14.1 ± 1.9 year) adolescents during treadmill and overground walking at standard and preferred speeds. Results: The treadmill induced almost identical mechanical changes to overground walking in TD adolescents and those with UCP, with the exception of potential and kinetic vertical and lateral mechanical works, which are both significantly increased in the overground-treadmill transition only in UCP (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: Adolescents with UCP have a reduced adaptive capacity in absorbing and decelerating the speed created by a treadmill (i.e., dynamic stability) compared to TD adolescents. This may have an important implication in rehabilitation programs that assess and train gait by using a treadmill in adolescents with UCP.},

abstract = {The relationship between muscle structure and function has been a matter of investigation since the Renaissance period. Extensive use of anatomical dissections and the introduction of the scientific method enabled early scholars to lay the foundations of muscle physiology and biomechanics. Progression of knowledge in these disciplines led to the current understanding that muscle architecture, together with muscle fibre contractile properties, has a major influence on muscle mechanical properties. Recently, advances in laser diffraction, optical microendoscopy and ultrasonography have enabled in vivo investigations into the behaviour of human muscle fascicles and sarcomeres with varying joint angle and muscle contraction intensity. With these technologies it has become possible to identify the length region over which fascicles and sarcomeres develop maximum isometric force in vivo as well as the operating ranges of fascicles and sarcomeres during real-life activities such as walking. Also, greater insights into the remodelling of muscle architecture in response to overloading and unloading, and in ageing, have been obtained by the use of ultrasonography; these have led to the identification of clinical biomarkers of disuse atrophy and sarcopenia. Recent evidence also shows that the pattern of muscle hypertrophy in response to chronic loading is contraction-mode dependent (eccentric versus concentric), as similar gains in muscle mass, but through differing addition of sarcomeres in series and in parallel (as indirectly inferred from changes in fascicle length and pennation angle), have been found. These innovative observations prompted a new set of investigations into the molecular mechanisms regulating this contraction-specific muscle growth.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify in vivo the fibre length (L)-to-moment arm (d) ratio (L/d) in the major ankle plantarflexors and knee extensors of 21 healthy men. Measurements of L were taken in the gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, soleus, vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius muscles using ultrasound scanning. Measurements of d were taken in the Achilles tendon (dAT) and patellar tendon (dPT) using magnetic resonance imaging. The relations between (a) L in each ankle plantarflexor muscle and dAT, (b) L in each knee extensor muscle and dPT, and (c) dATand dPT,were analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficients. There was no significant relation (P {\textgreater} 0.05) between any of the above parameters, with the correlation coefficient values ranging from -0.2 to 0.29. These results contradict previous findings that L scales with d, indicating that skeletal size differences between individuals may not always be associated with predictable differences in muscle architecture. This needs to be accounted for when information about the L/d ratio of a given muscle-joint in a given individual is required, as for example is the case when assessing the suitability of a potential donor muscle in surgical tendon transfer. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Current understanding of how muscles coordinate walking in humans is derived from analyses of body motion, ground reaction force and EMG measurements. This is Part I of a two-part review that emphasizes how muscle-driven dynamics-based simulations assist in the understanding of individual muscle function in walking, especially the causal relationships between muscle force generation and walking kinematics and kinetics. Part I reviews the strengths and limitations of Newton-Euler inverse dynamics and dynamical simulations, including the ability of each to find the contributions of individual muscles to the acceleration/deceleration of the body segments. We caution against using the concept of biarticular muscles transferring power from one joint to another to infer muscle coordination principles because energy flow among segments, even the adjacent segments associated with the joints, cannot be inferred from computation of joint powers and segmental angular velocities alone. Rather, we encourage the use of dynamical simulations to perform muscle-induced segmental acceleration and power analyses. Such analyses have shown that the exchange of segmental energy caused by the forces or accelerations induced by a muscle can be fundamentally invariant to whether the muscle is shortening, lengthening, or neither. How simulation analyses lead to understanding the coordination of seated pedaling, rather than walking, is discussed in this first part because the dynamics of pedaling are much simpler, allowing important concepts to be revealed. We elucidate how energy produced by muscles is delivered to the crank through the synergistic action of other non-energy producing muscles; specifically, that a major function performed by a muscle arises from the instantaneous segmental accelerations and redistribution of segmental energy throughout the body caused by its force generation. Part II reviews how dynamical simulations provide insight into muscle coordination of walking.},

abstract = {Running is a bouncing gait in which the body mass center slows and lowers during the first half of the stance phase; the mass center is then accelerated forward and upward into flight during the second half of the stance phase. Muscle-driven simulations can be analyzed to determine how muscle forces accelerate the body mass center. However, muscle-driven simulations of running at different speeds have not been previously developed, and it remains unclear how muscle forces modulate mass center accelerations at different running speeds. Thus, to examine how muscles generate accelerations of the body mass center, we created three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations of ten subjects running at 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0m/s. An induced acceleration analysis determined the contribution of each muscle to mass center accelerations. Our simulations included arms, allowing us to investigate the contributions of arm motion to running dynamics. Analysis of the simulations revealed that soleus provides the greatest upward mass center acceleration at all running speeds; soleus generates a peak upward acceleration of 19.8m/s2 (i.e., the equivalent of approximately 2.0 bodyweights of ground reaction force) at 5.0m/s. Soleus also provided the greatest contribution to forward mass center acceleration, which increased from 2.5m/s2 at 2.0m/s to 4.0m/s2 at 5.0m/s. At faster running speeds, greater velocity of the legs produced larger angular momentum about the vertical axis passing through the body mass center; angular momentum about this vertical axis from arm swing simultaneously increased to counterbalance the legs. We provide open-access to data and simulations from this study for further analysis in OpenSim at simtk.org/home/nmbl{\_}running, enabling muscle actions during running to be studied in unprecedented detail. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Inverted pendulum models of walking predict that little muscle work is required for the exchange of body potential and kinetic energy in single-limb support. External power during walking (product of the measured ground reaction force and body center-of-mass (COM) velocity) is often analyzed to deduce net work output or mechanical energetic cost by muscles. Based on external power analyses and inverted pendulum theory, it has been suggested that a primary mechanical energetic cost may be associated with the mechanical work required to redirect the COM motion at the step-to-step transition. However, these models do not capture the multi-muscle, multi-segmental properties of walking, co-excitation of muscles to coordinate segmental energetic flow, and simultaneous production of positive and negative muscle work. In this study, a muscle-actuated forward dynamic simulation of walking was used to assess whether: (1) potential and kinetic energy of the body are exchanged with little muscle work; (2) external mechanical power can estimate the mechanical energetic cost for muscles; and (3) the net work output and the mechanical energetic cost for muscles occurs mostly in double support. We found that the net work output by muscles cannot be estimated from external power and was the highest when the COM moved upward in early single-limb support even though kinetic and potential energy were exchanged, and muscle mechanical (and most likely metabolic) energetic cost is dominated not only by the need to redirect the COM in double support but also by the need to raise the COM in single support. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Simple models have elucidated the basic multisegmented ballistic and passive mechanics of walking. Dynamical models driven by net joint moments have provided clues about coordination in healthy and pathological gait. Simulations driven by muscle excitations have highlighted the partial stability afforded by muscles with their viscoelastic-like properties and the predictability of walking performance when minimization of metabolic energy per unit distance is assumed. When combined with neural control models for exciting motoneuronal pools, simulations have shown how the integrative properties of the neuro-musculo-skeletal systems maintain a stable gait. Other analyses of walking simulations have revealed how individual muscles contribute to trunk support and progression.

abstract = {One objective of this study was to investigate whether neuromuscular quantities were associated with preferred pedaling rate selection during submaximal steady-state cycling from a theoretical perspective using a musculoskeletal model with an optimal control analysis. Specific neuromuscular quantities of interest were the individual muscle activation, force, stress and endurance. To achieve this objective, a forward dynamic model of cycling and optimization framework were used to simulate pedaling at three different rates of 75, 90 and 105 rpm at 265 W. The pedaling simulations were produced by optimizing the individual muscle excitation timing and magnitude to reproduce experimentally collected data. The results from these pedaling simulations indicated that all neuromuscular quantities were minimized at 90 rpm when summed across muscles. In the context of endurance cycling, these results suggest that minimizing neuromuscular fatigue is an important mechanism in pedaling rate selection. A second objective was to determine whether any of these quantities could be used to predict the preferred pedaling rate. By using the quantities with the strongest quadratic trends as the performance criterion to be minimized in an optimal control analysis, these quantities were analyzed to assess whether they could be further minimized at 90 rpm and produce normal pedaling mechanics. The results showed that both the integrated muscle activation and average endurance summed across all muscles could be further minimized at 90 rpm indicating that these quantities cannot be used individually to predict preferred pedaling rates.},

The first was to develop a forward dynamic model of cycling and an optimization framework to simulate pedaling during submaximal steady-state cycling conditions. The second was to use the model and framework to identify the kinetic, kinematic, and muscle timing quantities that should be included in a performance criterion to reproduce natural pedaling mechanics best during these pedaling conditions. To make this identification, kinetic and kinematic data were collected from 6 subjects who pedaled at 90 rpm and 225 W. Intersegmental joint moments were computed using an inverse dynamics technique and the muscle excitation onset and offset were taken from electromyographic (EMG) data collected previously (Neptune et al., 1997). Average cycles and their standard deviations for the various quantities were used to describe normal pedaling mechanics. The model of the bicycle-rider system was driven by 15 muscle actuators per leg. The optimization framework determined both the timing and magnitude of the muscle excitations to simulate pedaling at 90 rpm and 225 W. Using the model and optimization framework, seven performance criteria were evaluated. The criterion that included all of the kinematic and kinetic quantities combined with the EMG timing was the most successful in replicating the experimental data. The close agreement between the simulation results and the experimentally collected kinetic, kinematic, and EMG data gives confidence in the model to investigate individual muscle coordination during submaximal steady-state pedaling conditions from a theoretical perspective, which to date has only been performed experimentally.},

We used pedaling as our movement paradigm because it is a constrained cyclical movement that allows for a controlled investigation of test conditions such as movement speed and effort. Altered task mechanics were introduced using an elliptical chainring. The kinematics of the crank were changed from a relatively constant angular velocity using a circular chainring to a widely varying angular velocity using an elliptical chainring. Kinetic, kinematic and muscle activity data were collected from eight competitive cyclists using three different chainrings - one circular and two different orientations of an elliptical chainring. We tested the hypotheses that muscle coordination patterns (EMG timing and magnitude), specifically the regions of active muscle force production, would shift towards regions in the crank cycle in which the crank angular velocity, and hence muscle contraction speeds, were favorable to produce muscle power as defined by the skeletal muscle power- velocity relationship. The results showed that our hypothesis with regards to timing was not supported. Although there were statistically significant shifts in muscle timing, the shifts were minor in absolute terms and appeared to be the result of the muscles accounting for the activation dynamics associated with muscle force development (i.e. the delay in muscle force rise and decay). But, significant changes in the magnitude of muscle EMG during regions of slow crank angular velocity for the tibialis anterior and rectus femoris were observed. Thus, the nervous system used adaptations to the muscle EMG magnitude, rather than the timing, to adapt to the altered task mechanics. The results also suggested that cyclists might work on the descending limb of the power-velocity relationship when pedaling at 90 rpm and sub-maximal power output. This finding might have important implications for preferred pedaling rate selection.},

abstract = {This study sought to find the optimal design parameters for a bicycle-rider system (crank length, pelvic inclination, seat height and rate of crank rotation) that maximise the power output from muscles of the human lower limb during cycling. The human lower limb was modelled as a planar system of five rigid bodies connected by four frictionless pin joints and driven by seven functional muscle groups. The muscles were assumed to behave according to an adapted form of Hill's (1938) equation, incorporating the muscle force-length relation. The force-length relation and the values of length that served as input into the relations of the various muscles were defined in the following two ways: (1) the force-length relation was parabolic, based on the experiment of Woittiez et al. (1984), and the length was defined as the whole muscle length; and (2) the force-length relation was expressed as a combination of lines, based on the cross-bridge theory, and the length was defined as muscle fibre length. In the second definition, the joint configurations at which four of the seven muscle groups reached optimal length (i.e. the length at which the muscle can exert maximal isometric force) were further given in two ways. The first way was consistent with a previous study from this laboratory (Yoshihuku and Herzog, 1990); the second way relied on unpublished experimental data. The dependence of the average power on the design parameters and definitions of the force-length relation and muscle length was examined. Maximal average power for one full crank rotation with a crank length of 0.17 m was found to be about 1300 W for definition 1 and 1000 W for definition 2. The average power was more sensitive to changes in design parameters in definition 2 than definition 1. The optimal rate of crank rotation with a crank length of 0.17 m was 18.4 rad s-1 (176 rev min-1) for definition 1 (this value is different from the result of the previous study due to revisions in input for two muscle groups), and 15.2 rad s-1 (145 rev min-1) and 14.6 rad s-1 (139 rev min-1) for definition 2.},

abstract = {Fish, birds and lizards sometimes perform locomotor activities with maximized muscle power. Whether humans maximize muscle power is unknown because current experimental techniques cannot be applied non-invasively. This study leveraged simulated muscle work loops to examine whether voluntary maximal cycling is characterized by maximized muscle power. The simulated work loops used experimentally measured joint angles, anatomically realistic muscle parameters (muscle–tendon lengths, velocities and moment arms) and a published muscle model to calculate power and force for 38 muscles. For each muscle, stimulation onset and offset were optimized to maximize muscle work and power for the complete shortening/lengthening cycle. Simulated joint power and total leg power (i.e. summed muscle power) were compared with previously reported experimental joint and leg power. Experimental power values were closely approximated by simulated maximal power for the leg [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.91], the hip (ICC=0.92) and the knee (ICC=0.95), but less closely for the ankle (ICC=0.74). Thus, during maximal cycling, humans maximize muscle power at the hip and knee, but the ankle acts to transfer (instead of maximize) power. Given that only the timing of muscle stimulation onset and offset were altered, these results suggest that human motor control strategies may optimize muscle activation to maximize power. The simulations also provide insight into biarticular muscle function by demonstrating that the power values at each joint spanned by a biarticular muscle can be substantially greater than the net power produced by the muscle. Our work-loop simulation technique may be useful for examining clinical deficits in muscle power production.},

abstract = {During submaximal cycling, children demonstrate a different distribution between muscular and non-muscular (gravitational and motion-dependent) forces when compared with adults. This is partly due to anthropometric differences. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that during maximum power cycling, children would construct the task (in terms of the distribution between muscular and non-muscular pedal power) similarly to adults. Eleven children (aged 8-9 years) and 13 adults (aged 20-40 years) performed a maximal isokinetic cycling task over 3 s at 115 r.p.m. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed no significant differences in normalized maximum, minimum and average positive non-muscular pedal power between children and adults (Wilks' lambda=0.755, F(3,20)=2.17, P=0.124). Thus, maximum cycling is a developmental ;self-scaling' task and age-related differences in muscular power production are not confounded by differences in anthropometry. This information is useful to researchers who wish to differentiate between muscular and non-muscular power when studying developmental motor control. In addition to the similarities in the distribution between muscular and non-muscular pedal power, we found age-related differences in the relative joint power contributions to total pedal power. In children, a significantly smaller proportion of total pedal power was generated at the ankle joint (6.1+/-5.4{\%} for children and 12.6+/-3.2{\%} for adults), whilst relatively more power was generated at the knee and hip joints. These results suggest that intermuscular coordination may be contributing to children's limits in maximum power production during multi-joint tasks.},

abstract = {Lower extremity joint moments were investigated in three cycling conditions: level seated, uphill seated and uphill standing. Based on a previous study (Caldwell, Li, McCole, {\&} Hagberg, 1998), it was hypothesized that joint moments in the uphill standing condition would be altered in both magnitude and pattern. Eight national caliber cyclists were filmed while riding their own bicycles mounted to a computerized ergometer. Applied forces were measured with an instrumented pedal, and inverse dynamics were used to calculate joint moments. In the uphill seated condition the joint moments were similar in profile to the level seated but with a modest increase in magnitude. In the uphill standing condition the peak ankle plantarflexor moment was much larger and occurred later in the downstroke than in the seated conditions. The extensor knee moment that marked the first portion of the downstroke for the seated trials was extended much further into the downstroke while standing, and the subsequent knee flexor moment period was of lower magnitude and shorter duration. These moment changes in the standing condition can be explained by a combination of more forward hip and knee positions, increased magnitude of pedal force, and an altered pedal force vector direction. The data support the notion of an altered contribution of both muscular and non-muscular sources to the applied pedal force. Muscle length estimates and muscle activity data from an earlier study (Li {\&} Caldwell, 1996) support the unique roles of mono-articular muscles for energy generation and bi-articular muscles for balancing of adjacent joint moments in the control of pedal force vector direction},

abstract = {Biomechanical studies often employ optical motion capture systems for the determination of the position of an object in a room-based coordinate system. This is not ideal for many types of study in locomotion since only a few strides may be collected per ;trial', and outdoor experiments are difficult with some systems. Here, we report and evaluate a novel approach that enables the user to determine linear displacements of a proprietary orientation sensor during cyclical movement. This makes experiments outside the constraints of the laboratory possible, for example to measure mechanical energy fluctuations of the centre of mass during over-ground locomotion. Commercial orientation sensors based on inertial sensing are small and lightweight and provide a theoretical framework for determining position from acceleration. In practice, the integration process is difficult to implement because of integration errors, integration constants and the necessity to determine the orientation of the measured accelerations. Here, by working within the constraints of cyclical movements, we report and evaluate a method for determining orientation and relative position using a modified version of a commercial inertial orientation sensor that combines accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers, thus giving a full set of movement parameters (displacement, velocity and acceleration in three dimensions). The 35 g sensor was attached over the spine of a horse exercising on a treadmill. During canter locomotion (9.0 m s-1), the amplitudes of trunk movement in the x (craniocaudal), y (mediolateral) and z (dorsoventral) directions were 99.6, 57.9 and 140.2 mm, respectively. Comparing sensor displacement values with optical motion capture values for individual strides, the sensor had a median error (25th, 75th percentile) in the x, y and z directions of 0.1 (-9.7, +10.8), -3.8 (-15.5, +13.7) and -0.1 (-6.3, +7.1) mm, respectively. High-pass filtering of the displacement data effectively separated non-cyclical from cyclical components of the movement and reduced the interquartile ranges of the errors considerably to (-3.6, 6.2), (-4.0, 3.8) and (-4.5, 5.1) for x, y and z displacement, respectively, during canter locomotion. This corresponds to (-3.2, 5.5){\%}, (-6.7, 6.3){\%} and (-3.3, 3.7){\%} of the range of motion.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that govern the voluntary transition from walking to running as walking speed increases in human gait are not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that plantar flexor muscle force production is greatly impaired at the preferred transition speed (PTS) due to intrinsic muscle properties and, thus, serves as a determinant for the walk-to-run transition. The plantar flexors have been shown to be important contributors to satisfying the mechanical energetic demands of walking and are the primary contributors to the observed ground reaction forces (GRFs) during the propulsion phase. Thus, if the plantar flexor force production begins to diminish near the PTS despite an increase in muscle activation, then a corresponding decrease in the GRFs during the propulsion phase would be expected. This expectation was supported. Both the peak anterior/posterior and vertical GRFs decreased during the propulsion phase at walking speeds near the PTS. A similar decrease was not observed during the braking phase. Further analysis using forward dynamics simulations of walking at increasing speeds and running at the PTS revealed that all lower extremity muscle forces increased with walking speed, except the ankle plantar flexors. Despite an increase in muscle activation with walking speed, the gastrocnemius muscle force decreased with increasing speed, and the soleus force decreased for walking speeds exceeding 80{\%} PTS. These decreases in force production were attributed to the intrinsic force-length-velocity properties of muscle. In addition, the running simulation analysis revealed that the plantar flexor forces nearly doubled for similar activation levels when the gait switched to a run at the PTS due to improved contractile conditions. These results suggest the plantar flexors may serve as an important determinant for the walk-to-run transition and highlight the important role intrinsic muscle properties play in determining the specific neuromotor strategies used in human locomotion.},

abstract = {Soft tissue artefacts (STA) are a major error source in skin marker-based measurement of human movement, and are difficult to eliminate non-invasively. The current study quantified in vivo the STA of skin markers on the thigh and shank during cycling, and studied the effects of knee angles and pedal resistance by using integrated 3D fluoroscopy and stereophotogrammetry. Fifteen young healthy adults performed stationary cycling with and without pedal resistance, while the marker data were measured using a motion capture system, and the motions of the femur and tibia/fibula were recorded using a bi-plane fluoroscopy-to-CT registration method. The STAs with respect to crank and knee angles over the pedaling cycle, as well as the within-cycle variations, were obtained and compared between resistance conditions. The thigh markers showed greater STA than the shank ones, the latter varying linearly with adjacent joint angles, the former non-linearly with greater within-cycle variability. Both STA magnitudes and within-cycle variability were significantly affected by pedal resistance (p {\textless}. 0.05). The STAs appeared to be composed of one component providing the stable and consistent STA patterns and another causing their variations. Mid-segment markers experienced smaller STA ranges than those closer to a joint, but tended to have greater variations primarily associated with pedal resistance and muscle contractions. The current data will be helpful for a better choice of marker positions for data collection, and for developing methods to compensate for both stable and variation components of the STA.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to study the utilization of range of motion at the hip, knee, and ankle joints during exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Six healthy subjects biked at different workloads, pedaling rates, saddle heights, and pedal foot positions. The subjects were filmed in the sagittal plane with a cine-film camera at 60 frames/sec. The mean hip range of motion (ROM) during normal cycling was 38 degrees ranging from 32-70 degrees hip flexion. The mean knee ROM was 66 degrees ranging from 46-112 degrees knee flexion, and the ankle ROM was 24 degrees ranging from 2 degrees plantarflexion to 22 degrees dorsiflexion. The hip, knee, and ankle joint motions were influenced by changes of the saddle height or pedal foot position. Different workloads had a small but statistically significant influence on the joint motions while different pedaling rates did not significantly change the lower limb joint motions. The range of motion utilized during cycling is approximately equal to, but more flexed compared to level walking and stair walking. The most effective way of increasing the ROM and obtaining more extension of the lower limb joints is to change the saddle height.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 1988;9(8):273-278.},
